version 0.50 (09/09/2010)
    Compound Objects:
    * Added Yellow border around selected resource nodes in the graphical editor
      to make it easier to identify the selected resource
    * Multi-selection is now supported in the graphical editor: hold down shift

      keys to move all selected resource nodes at once, or hit delete to remove
      them.
    * Additional auto-layout option in graphical editor context menu: auto
      layout using connections works as before (good for compound objects with a
      lot of relationships between resources), the new 'auto layout' simply
      realigns the resources using a grid pattern. Use them in combination for

      button): 
        * add URL directly allows you to type or paste the URL rather than
          adding the address from the browser address bar: this works better for
          persistent URLs that redirect to some other address eg handle.net or
          doi URLs
        * Add resources from tabs: allows you to select resources currently open
          in browser tabs to add them at the same time.

    * Fixes bug with multiple rdf:type properties being shown for nested
      compound objects and annotations
    * Always use styleSheet when launching aggregated annotations in browser eg
      from slideshow (no more ugly XML)
    * Link added to jump to slides for related resources in slideshow (only if
      they are in the same compound object)
    * Edit buttons in properties are now always visible, even when there is a
      scroll bar

    Annotations:
    * Fixed highlighting of annotation contexts when URL ends with fragment
    * Completely redesigned appearance of annotation search results
    * Updated appearance of browse panel, tags now displayed

      usability, stability and scalability.

    Compound Objects:
    * Display of properties and relationships in details and slideshow view
      improved: all values displayed for multi-valued properties, properties
      have been sorted.
    * User can choose to show abstract instead of resource preview for each
      resource in the graphical editor : right-click on a node and check
      'Abstract preview' from the context menu
    * The abstract is also displayed when hovering mouse over title of resource
      node in graphical editor
    * Find in text function added to toolbar: for searching within text
      displayed in views
    * Datatype properties from the default ontology can be added to resources
      via the property editor
    * Split summary into resource list and details view. Resource list is a work
      in progress: it will allow resources to be reordered in a future release.
    * Menus in the graphical editor now have scrollers at top and bottom rather
      than extending off screen
    * User is now warned if they are opening another compound object without
      saving changes that have been made to a compound object that they created

    * Links shown in annotations in browse view open in browser when clicked
    * Improved support for login to Secure annotation server when
      deleting/searching/browsing annotations

    * Fixed some problems with escaping unsafe characters in URLs
    * Added a popup editor for annotation metadata fields
    * Ontology for metadata annotations can now be specified in the preferences

      entities.
    * The Annotation server has been upgraded: the default configuration has
      been changed to reflect the new address of the server.

version 0.48 (05/08/2010)
    Compound Objects:
    * Don't show the explore view when the current compound object is unsaved
    * Show information about relations with hover tooltips

    * Fix the display and creation of Annotations on pages with percent
      characters in their URLs
    * Annotation popups are easier to read, with a larger font and extra
      spacing.
    * Annotation popups wait a moment before displaying, to prevent their
      unwanted display when just moving the mouse over the page
    * Annotation popups now hide themselves when the page changes or another
      annotation is selected
    * Clean up the page markers for Metadata Annotations when closing the editor
      or switching tabs
    * Much better highlighting of Metadata Annotations on Austlit

version 0.47 (22/07/2010)
    Compound Objects:
    * Graphical editor now supports panning with the mouse (drag anywhere on the
      background to move the diagram around) and shows guidelines to help align
      layout when positioning resource nodes.
    * Clicking inside a preview in the graphical editor or slideshow now opens
      the resource in the main browser window.
    * Resource properties and relationships have been split into two separate
      panels on the properties tab so that when a resource is selected in the
      graphical view, properties and a summary of all relationships are
      displayed.
    * Fixed some minor selection bugs in the graphical editor
    * Workaround for Firefox iframe rendering bug that was causing flickering in
      the pop up property editor.
    * Further improvements to explore view: long titles ellided, added zoom
      in/out options to explore view context menu (mouse scroll wheel can also
      be used), minor fix for color coding relationships.

    Annotations:
    * URLs can be copied from editor fields for VariationAnnotations
    * Removed alternate body field from scholarly annotations

    Improvements to compound objects explore view: 
    * Connections between nodes are now color coded.
    * Nodes can be dragged to reposition by dragging on the circle/square. A
      contextmenu on each node in the explore view provides access to
      expand/remove the node.
    * Clicking on the node label also expands the node.
    * Labels can be shown or hidden via a contextmenu anywhere on the background
      of the explore view.
    * Other options in the contextmenu include export to image, resetting the
      visualization and viewing the color codes for the connections.

    Other changes to compound objects:
    * The title of the current compound object is now always displayed in the
      status bar.
    * Javascript is now allowed in previews as they are sandboxed.
    * Plugins (eg for Flash, PDF content) in previews are still disabled.

    Annotations:
    * Improvements to Metadata (formerly known as Semantic) annotations
    * Variation panel appearance has been improved
    * Better handling of errors in highlighting annotation contexts
    * Fixed field focus problems in editor
    * URL fragments are ignored when fetching annotations for the current page

    Compound objects:
    * Recently viewed compound objects have been moved from the Browse tab to
      the History tab
    * Lists of compound objects in the Browse, History and Search tabs are now
      paged and sortable, to make it easier to work with large lists
    * In the Properties view, clicking on the ... button next to a property
      value will pop up a larger editor to make it easier to read and edit long
      text fields like abstracts. The property value must be clicked first
      before the button will appear.

version 0.44 (10/06/2010)
    Compound Objects:
    * Compound objects from other repositories are now indicated in the recently
      viewed list using a greyed icon. Save/delete is disabled for compound
      objects from repositories other than the default from the preferences.
    * Added icons to jump between different views eg scroll directly to node in
      graphical editor from the corresponding slide in the slideshow.
    * When adding a node to the graphical editor, the editor now scrolls to the
      position where the node was added.
    * Undo has been improved so that adds, moves, deletes, relationship
      connection and relationship type selection within the graphical editor are
      undoable. Undo/redo in the graphical editor made more obvious - they are
      available via keyboard shortcuts or using the graphical editor context
      menu. Property changes are not yet able to be undone via the menu, but can
      be undone while editing a property using keyboard shortcuts.
    * Added button to reset slideshow preview (to allow return to original
      resource after navigation within preview).
    * Timestamps now stored for created, modified dates
    * Explore view can be saved to image file via context menu
    * Other minor UI changes eg additional icons etc based on user feedback

    Annotations:
    * Search UI improved: tooltips on all fields, and double clicking the result
      row launches the annotated resource in the browser (rather than the user
      having to click specifically on the URI ).
    * Annotation context menu has additional action: view annotation in browser
      (from search or browse view).
    * Creator and title field are now required by the editor for all annotations
    * Improvements to semantic annotations: working towards enabling attachment
      of metadata via metadata editor, configured by a custom ontology: current
      implementation is very experimental.

version 0.43 (27/05/2010)
    UI changes based on User Feedback

    Annotations:
    * Annotation browse tab automatically activates when annotations detected
    * Image annotation markers thicker to make them easier to see
    * Annotation search and editor UI improvements e.g. double-click on search
      result rows to open in browser


    Compound Objects:
    * Fixed bug with nested compound objects sometimes displaying as RDF/XML
    * Button added to allow adding current page to compound object from address
      bar
    * Source metadata added automatically for images added to compound object
      via context menu
    * Undo/Redo made more obvious in graphical editor with context menu entries
      (previously keyboard shortcuts only)
    * Jump to slideshow from graphical editor node via context menu

version 0.421 (13/05/2010)
    Please Note that Semantic Annotations are not working correctly in this release.

    General:
    * High contrast theme is now selectable in the preferences
    * Some uneccessary files were removed from the distribution to make it a
      smaller download.

    Annotations:
    * User interface improvements based on user feedback

    Compound Objects:
    * Fixed bug that was preventing external relationship ontologies from
      loading.
    * Improved Compound Object search so that there is now an implicit AND
      between search terms. Use quotes for phrase searching. (Old behaviour was
      that all searches were phrase searches).
    * Slideshow view now displays contents from nested compound objects up to 2
      levels deep (any deeply nested compound objects will still need to be
      loaded separately in LORE).
    * External web pages now appear in the slideshow preview, however for
      security reasons the content has been sandboxed. For example Flash content
      (such as YouTube movies) is disabled, so some pages may not display
      correctly in the preview. For these pages we recommend clicking on the
      resource title to launch the page in the main browser.

version 0.41 (29/04/2010)
    This release contains a number of UI improvements based on user feedback.

    Annotations:
      Annotation editor panel: 
        * Added button to cancel edits
        * Removed delete as this function is available from the toolbar and
          context menu
        * Fixed bug with formatting options (bold, italic etc) being ignored
          introduced in recent versions of Firefox
        * Improvements to hiding/showing fields
        * Fix bugs causing strange behaviour when selecting annotations or
          changing tab or page

      Toolbar:
        * Save button removed as this function is available from the editor for
          the currently selected annotation (or use the Save all button to save
          all modified annotations)
      Timeline:
        * Improvements/bug fixes

    Compound objects:
      UI changes:
        * Single click to open compound objects (was previously double click)
        * Nodes can be added to compound object by dragging links from browser
          onto compound object editor
        * Nested compound objects can be loaded by single clicking on URI
          displayed in node
        * Plus/minus icon accurately reflects whether node is expanded
        * Display message to let users know when compound object is loading
        * Don't prompt to save immediately after deleting the loaded compound
          object
        * Relationship labels centered

      Improvements to importing/exporting RDF/XML:
        * Fixed bug with importing external RDF containing unknown namespaces
        * Ensure that aggregation properties are retained (even though LORE does
          not display or allow them to be edited)
        * NOTE: The graphical editor does not currently support reflexive
          relationships (i.e. relationships from a node to itself), however if
          they are present in imported RDF, they will be displayed in the
          properties panel.
        * RDF/XML now serialised using rdfquery
