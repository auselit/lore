		<h1>LORE: Literature Object Re-use and Exchange: Compound Objects</h1>
		<p>LORE aims to support the digital practice of researchers and teachers of literary cultures through <b>compound object authoring</b>, allowing them to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="#gather"><b>Gather</b></a> web resources and organise and tag them, describe links between them and make notes about them using a graphical editor.</li>
					<li><a href="#discover"><b>Discover</b></a> compound objects that others have created about related topics and web resources.</li>
				<li><a href="#save"><b>Publish</b></a> the information that you have gathered as <i>compound objects</i> so that others can find them and reuse the information.</li>
				<li><a href="#present"><b>Present</b></a> the information that you have gathered and discovered using automatically generated slideshows and diagrams.</li>
				</ul>
			<!--li><b><a href="#tm">Text-mining:</a></b> Highlight names of people, places and events within the text of the current web resource.</li-->
		
        <p><b>Note</b>: Similarly to browser favourites or bookmarks, LORE only stores links to the online materials that you include in compound objects - it does not take copies of those materials. We suggest that you select resources hosted at reliable institutions or archives to avoid broken links within your compound objects, and that you use persistent URIs for each resource (such as DOIs) where available.</p>

        <h2>Preferences</h2>
		
		<p>You can configure LORE's features via the preferences. Select <img src="chrome://lore/skin/icons/cog.png" alt="View or edit LORE preferences" title="View or edit LORE preferences"> from the toolbar to show the preferences window. You can also access the preferences when LORE is hidden via the Options button in the Firefox Add-Ons window. Select Tools > Add-Ons from the browser menu to display the Add-Ons window, then select LORE from the list of Add-Ons to access LORE's Options button.</p>
		<p>You can enter your name (used to identify you as the creator of compound objects), and enable or disable LORE's features via the General preferences. Expert users have the option to configure more specific details for each service. For example, you can change the location of the compound objects repository or specify an ontology describing alternate relationship types to relate resources within compound objects.</p>
		
        <h3>Hiding/Showing LORE</h3>
        <p>LORE can be toggled between hidden and visible, so that it does not take up space on screen while you browse. To hide or show LORE, click on the icon in the status bar, or select Tools > LORE from the browser menu.</p>
        
        </p>
        <h3>Compound object editor</h3>
        <p>
            The compound object editor can be used to view, edit or create a compound object.
        </p>
        <h4>Viewing or Editing existing compound objects</h4>
        <p>While you are browsing, any compound objects associated with the page that you are currently viewing in the browser will be displayed in the panel to the left of the editor area. You can click on these to load the compound object in the editor for viewing or editing.</p>
        <h4>Creating a compound object</h4>
        <p>By default, LORE starts with a new compound object so you can start adding resources straight away. If you have been browsing existing compound objects and wish to start editing a new compound object, select <img src="chrome://lore/skin/icons/database_add.png" alt="Create a new compound object" title="Create"> from the toolbar.</p>

        <h4 id="gather">Gather resources into a compound object</h4>
        <p>LORE offers several ways to add resources to the compound object that is open in the editor:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Address bar button: You can add the page that you are currently viewing in the browser to the compound object by selecting <img src="chrome://lore/skin/icons/ore_add.png" alt="Add" title="Add browser URL to LORE compound object"/> displayed next to the URL in the address bar. You can add resources to the compound object in this way even if LORE is hidden. If the current page is in the compound object that is open in LORE's editor, the icon will display as <img src="chrome://lore/skin/icons/ore_added.png" alt="Added" title=""/>, and clicking on this icon will unhide LORE.</li>
        <li>Browser context menus: To add links or images that are displayed on the current page, right-click on the link or image and select 'Add linked resource to ORE object' or 'Add image to ORE object'. These menus will add the resources to the compound object even when LORE is hidden. You can also drag and drop contained links directly into the LORE editor using your mouse, when LORE is visible.</li>
        <li>Toolbar button: When LORE is visible, you can also add the page that you are currently viewing in the browser to the compound object by selecting <img src="chrome://lore/skin/icons/add.png" alt="Add" title="Add"/> from LORE's toolbar.</li> 
        </ul>
        
        <p>Once you have added a resource, it will appear as a resource node in the graphical editor. Use the minus (or plus) icon in the top-right of the node to collapse and expand the node preview. You can also reposition nodes using the mouse or resize them by clicking on a node and then dragging the resize handles.</p> 
        
        <p>If you wish to delete a resource node, select it and press the delete or backspace key, or right-click on the node and select 'Delete' from the context menu.  You can undo your actions within the editor using Control-Z (Command-Z on Mac) or right-click anywhere in the background of the editor to select Undo from the context menu. To redo an undone action, use Control-Y (Command-Y on Mac) or select Redo from the editor context menu.</p>
        
        <h4>Resource properties and relationships</h4>
        <p>To create a connection indicating a relationship between two resources, click and drag from a connection point on the first resource node, to a connection point on the second node. Right-click the connection to select the relationship type from the context menu. The relationship types in the menu are configured from the ontology specified in the preferences. You can delete a connection by selecting it with the mouse and then pressing delete or backspace on the keyboard.</p>
        <p>Click on a node or connection to display its properties in the 'Resource/Relationship' property panel to the left of the editor. Properties such as title and format will be created automatically using information provided by the browser. You can edit or delete these values or add properties to record additional information about the resource. Properties can be edited by clicking on the value displayed next to the property name in the property panel. You can add additional properties from the menu that displays when you click on the plus icon shown above the list of properties. To remove a property, first select it and then click on the minus button (this action cannot be undone).</p>
        
        <h4>Compound object properties</h4>
        <p>The properties for the compound object as a whole are displayed above the Resource/Relationship properties. You can add properties such as an abstract or description to describe the collection of resources that you have gathered.</p>
        
        <h4 id="save">Publish: Saving to the repository</h4>
        <p>When you are ready to publish your compound object, select save <img src="chrome://lore/skin/icons/database_save.png" alt="Save" title="Save"> from the toolbar. This will save the compound object to the repository. </p>
        <p>If you wish to delete a compound object permanently, select delete <img src="chrome://lore/skin/icons/database_delete.png" alt="Delete" title="Delete"> from the toolbar. This action cannot be undone.</p>

        
		<h3>Other views of compound objects</h3>
        <p>In addition to the graphical editor, LORE provides the following views to help you to discover and present compound objects:</p>
        <p id="present">Present:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <b>Resources</b> view lists the resources that are aggregated by the compound object that is currently loaded in the editor. You can export the information from this view to a MS Word document by selecting the <img src="chrome://lore/skin/icons/page_white_word.png" alt="Word" title="Word"> icon at the top right of the view.</li>
            <li>The <b>Slideshow</b> view displays a slide for each resource showing a preview of the resource and a summary of properties attached to that resource. Selecting the play button will start the slideshow, which will automatically loop through the slides, displaying each for a few seconds. When the slideshow is paused, you can use the forward and back buttons to navigate between slides.</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="discover">Discover:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Related compound objects: While you are browsing, any compound objects from the repository that contain the page being viewed in the browser are shown in the Related Compound Objects list to the left of the editor. Compound objects that you have viewed previously are shown in the Recently Viewed Compound Objects list to allow you to return to compound objects that you have discovered in previous sessions.</li>
            <li>Search: The search panel can be accessed by clicking on the Search tab in the left-hand panel. The keyword search performs a case-insensitive search across all values from the repository, while advanced search allows you to narrow the search to specific properties or resources. There is an implicit AND between search terms, use double quotes for phrase search.</li>
            <li>The <b>Explore</b> view allows you to navigate visually through the relationships between resources and compound objects from the repository. 
            <ul>
                <li>The red square indicates where you started exploring, and orange circles represent compound objects.</li>
                <li>By default, the view starts from the currently loaded compound object, displaying connections to each of the resources that it aggregates. Clicking on any of the nodes in the visualisation will cause the visualisation to be re-centered around that node and relationships between that node and other compound objects or resources to be added to the visualisation. Right-clicking any node within the compound object editor gives you the option to reset the visualisation starting with that resource. You can also reset the view back to the default by selecting the 'Reset visualisation' link at the bottom-left.</li>
                <li>The nodes that you have visited while exploring are shown along the top of the view, with the most recent appearing at the left. You can open web resources that you have visited in the browser by clicking on <img src="chrome://lore/skin/icons/page_go.png" alt="Show in browser" title="Show in browser">, displayed to the left of each node title, or by clicking on <img src="chrome://lore/skin/oaioreicon-sm.png" alt="Load in LORE" title="Load in LORE"> to open a compound object in LORE.</li>   
                <li>Note: The explore view only shows relationships that have been saved to the repository. If you have not loaded a compound object, or if you have not yet saved your new compound object, this view will not display anything useful.</li>     
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
 
        <p>Additional specialised views may be enabled in your copy of LORE: These can be selected from the context menu which is displayed when you right-click any of the existing view tabs.</p>
        
        <h3>Import/Export</h3>
        <p>You can save a backup of your compound objects to a RDF/XML file on your computer by selecting the 'Export to RDF/XML' option from the drop down menu next to the save icon. You can open the RDF/XML files saved from LORE using 'Import from RDF/XML file' in the same menu. Additional export and import options are available from this menu for advanced users.</p>
        
        <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
        As LORE is currently being developed, sometimes display glitches will occur. If LORE starts behaving strangely, you can reset it to its initial state by selecting <img src="chrome://lore/skin/icons/arrow_refresh.png" alt="Reset UI" title="Reset">. If problems persist, please contact us.
