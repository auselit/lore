Procession of Egos.</h4>
               J. F. Millington
               
               <p class="noindent">ON each side of him, for many a mile,
 extended a pebbled beach shut in by hazy headlands. The quiet sea 
chafed gently at his
                  feet on a myriad little stones—once hugest boulders, 
now worn by unwearied Time into minute and most diverse shapes.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He stooped and separated one stone from
 its fellows—it was so very circular. It was somewhat flat; about the 
size of a small
                  coin.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Chance has formed this little pebble 
so, he thought. Then .. what Chance?</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The Philosopher put the little stone 
disc in his pocket and walked home, considering deeply. He went at once 
to his laboratory
                  and measured the granite fragment with his most 
delicate instruments. To their mechanism, capable of discriminating to a
 thousandth
                  part of an inch, the circle of the thing was round, 
try it which way he would—round absolutely. The Philosopher was 
disturbed.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He leaned his head upon his hands, with
 his eyes fixed upon the insignificant pebble placed on the table before
 him.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"It seems to me," he mused, "it is no 
mere speculation. It is a certainty—it must be. Yet I will place the 
argument on paper
                  so that no error may creep in."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He was trembling as he took a pen and 
wrote:</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"The conception of Space necessarily 
insists upon an infinity of Space. If Space be not infinite, it must 
have a boundary.
                  But if that boundary be not infinite, itself must have
 a boundary and so on—to infinity.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 2] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">"And for similar reasons, the 
conception of Time implies an infinity of Time.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Therefore the material Universe—what 
we call Matter—occurs in an infinity of Space and Time.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"But if Space and Time be infinite, why
 not Matter? The infinite repetition of Matter is at least as likely as 
its sudden
                  cessation. So far as human knowledge extends, Matter <i>is</i>
 infinitely repeated.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"And, so far as human knowledge 
extends, Matter is identical in essence. There is at least as much 
likelihood that its primal
                  elements will remain the same as there is that they 
will change to something inconceivably different.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"This Matter must be held or governed 
by a condition of its own existence—since Space and Time are 
abstractions.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"And as Matter is identical, the Law 
which governs it must also be identical.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"This pebble in all its remarkable 
rotundity was formed by what we call Chance, which in its last analysis 
is only an expression
                  of Law, and is certain and entirely inflexible.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Given Sea, and Stone, and Time long 
enough, a shape such as this <i>must</i> have been formed.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"And if this shape, in the chances 
which Time never-ending must bring, then every and any other shape.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"But Time is not operating in its 
chances on this World alone, but on all other Worlds which it has 
formed, extending in Space
                  illimitably.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Therefore other discs the very 
counterpart of this must exist in other Worlds.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"And, the Worlds being unlimited in 
number, the perfect discs must be unlimited.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"But Chance must repeat the shape and 
characteristics of this World as it repeats the discs.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"And, as the Worlds are unlimited, and 
Time has never begun nor yet can end, some World must be so like that 
the similarity
                  will extend to every islet, to every rock, to every<span
 class="pb"> [PAGE 3] </span>pebble, and to that pebble's exact position
 on the sea-beach as I found this.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Chance, then, in its infinite variety,
 must at this moment hold sway over a World which is in everything the 
precise replica
                  of this World—with like human beings, like laws, 
customs, languages, and religions—like to the tiniest grain of sand, and
                  to the most transient thought flickering through a 
brain—a perfect identity.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"There must be therefore a Man like 
me—of my name—of my past—a Man who is now writing—who is now thinking 
what I am now thinking—who
                  picked up lately, as I did, a remarkable pebble.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"But, as there is a limitless series of
 Worlds subject to Chance, there must be a limitless series of Worlds 
such as this.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"And as Time ever was and ever will be,
 there now as necessarily must be, must ever have been, and ever will 
be, an infinite
                  series of ..."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He broke off here—the room seemed so 
small and its confines so insupportable. He went out into the night 
wind, which enveloped
                  him with its grateful chill.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">A swart cloud hung sullen under the 
face of the moon. Before him crouched in the darkness an undefined mass.
 It was a rugged
                  hill, strewn with rocks and smoothed boulders. He 
gained the summit, and bared his head to the stronger breeze. The cloud
                  had moved and no longer prevented the moon's light.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">And the Philosopher now for the first 
time became aware of a rhythmic murmur—not loud and thundering, but 
enormous in its
                  pervasiveness. <i>Tramp!</i>—it sounded ... <i>tramp!</i>
 ... <i>tramp!</i> ...
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He looked at the landscape below and 
saw at first dimly, then quite distinctly, an expanse of people. It was 
the noise of
                  their walking he had heard as they marched past the 
hill with measured and unhurried step. They entirely filled the view,
                  save on the side on which he stood, and they rolled on
 as a sea that rolls to meet a sea.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 4] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">Looking still more intently, the 
Philosopher perceived with a terror, the like of which he had never 
imagined before, that
                  every man of the crowd was a likeness of himself 
dreadful in its exactness.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Yet they paid no sort of attention to 
him, but continued their sombre way.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Impelled by a strange curiosity, he 
shouted to them:</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Where do I come from?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He had intended to say—"Where do <i>you</i>
 come from?" but in some inexplicable way, and in spite of himself, he 
was compelled to say "I" instead of "you."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then all who marched below, to the most
 remote of them, turned their heads backwards and peered at him with 
contracted brows,
                  and peered most curiously, and said together in one 
great voice, enquiringly, yet somewhat sadly withal:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Where do I come from?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then he asked again, being again 
impelled to say "I" instead of "you":</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"How far do I extend?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">And all the men who marched below 
suddenly raised themselves a-tip-toe to look over one another's head, 
and answered blankly:</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"How far do I extend?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">And once more, notwithstanding his 
fear, he asked a further question, not this time essaying to speak the 
word "you," for
                  it was impossible:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Where am I going?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">And at this question all the landscape 
of faces with the moon-light on them turned towards him, and looked at 
him with frightful
                  mockery, and answered:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Where am I going?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">But the sound of their voice was so 
loud and pervading that the hill on which he stood quivered to its 
rooted depths. Its
                  cliffs rose from the earth and flung themselves 
headlong down sheer steeps. Massy stones, lying squat, starred and split
 to
                  their bellied<span class="pb"> [PAGE 5] </span>bases. 
The rounded granite pebbles crumbled into dust. The moon herself, 
serenest of spheres, darkened her ray and trembled
                  in her silver chains; and the stars sparkled fitfully 
and sought vainly to forsake their customed paths. Nor was the sound
                  unfelt by the nether and piled universes for ever.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He hastened down the quaking hillside 
and joined the infinite throng.</p>

               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 6] </span><h4 class="normal">A 
Row in Our Boarding-House.</h4>
               James Edmond
               
               <p class="noindent">THE trouble began on the night when a
 newly-imported British youth named Johnson appeared at our 
boarding-house.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">There were ten of us there before his 
arrival, including Bem, the Polish tailor, who was vaguely understood to
 have thrown
                  bombs at all the royal families of Europe, and then 
gone into exile. We paid seventeen shillings a week each, not including
                  washing; and we lived riotously on boiled mutton. 
There were more empty beer-bottles in the bedrooms, and more laughter, 
and
                  more grease slopped on the floor, and the candle-ends 
got into the soup oftener in that boarding-house than in any other I
                  ever heard of. Also, the neighbours got less sleep 
than anybody ever did in the vicinity of any other boarding-house. The
                  dining-room had not been papered since the beginning 
of history, and the landlady had only one eye; also, her daughter had
                  recently eloped with a non-union printer. She, the 
landlady, was aged about 40, and wore a green dress, and in the evenings
                  she used to sing songs to us with her hair down. These
 few details will convey a reasonably good idea of the nature of that
                  wild Bohemian establishment.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">One windy evening in March, the 
landlady had agitated the bell on the stairs, as was her custom. Her 
weapon was a sort of
                  cowbell, and when she wrestled with it on the murky 
staircase she looked like a witch dancing on a heath. Her arms, her 
hair,
                  her feet, her green dress, her trodden-down shoes flew
 in eight different directions, and her one eye and the bell flew in
                  two more. Strangers coming down in the dark, and 
meeting this apparition suddenly, generally took her for a heap of 
boa-constrictor,
                  or an immense octopus leaping on the top step. Poor 
old agitated female—she is dead now. She broke her neck in the passage
                  one day, rushing<span class="pb"> [PAGE 7] </span>down
 to look at a funeral. But if she had kept on ringing that dinner-bell 
she would have been immortal. Death couldn't have
                  aimed straight enough to hit her in her gambols.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I rushed down to the dining-room at the
 first signal, and, meeting Bem and two more coming tumultuously in the 
opposite direction,
                  we got jammed in the doorway. I was just going to pass
 some uncomplimentary observations when we all caught sight of a 
spectacle
                  such as the oldest individual in that boarding-house 
had never seen before. A great calm descended upon us, and we 
disentangled
                  ourselves and went in silently.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">What I saw was an object like a naked 
infant's hind-leg, resting in a careless, graceful attitude against a 
chair. There was
                  a bracelet on it, and attached to one end of it was a 
woman. She was attired in a silk dress which exposed her right down
                  to the fifth knob of her spine, or thereabouts, and 
she had a necklace, and an eye-glass, and sundry rings. There was a 
frozen
                  expression in her eye—a look of cold derision that 
seemed to fall like a curse upon the whole company. This was Johnson's
                  wife. Johnson himself was there, in a tail-coat, and a
 tremendous collar, and another eye-glass, and he had a silver bangle
                  on his wrist. He was the first male human being that I
 ever saw inside a bangle, and I am prepared to swear that he was the
                  very first who ever wore a bangle in a boarding-house.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Between them they made just one remark 
all dinner-time. It was "Haw!" I could have said the same thing myself 
if I had been
                  dead.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">We did not eat much that evening, and 
there was very little conversation. We were all paralysed by the 
spectacle of Johnson
                  and his wife. They kept looking round the table in a 
pensive, perplexed sort of way, as if they were searching for some of
                  the commonest necessaries of life, such as were to be 
found in stacks in their ancestral castle; and then they would wake
                  up as from a dream, and recollect suddenly that they 
were castaways in a savage land where the wild aborigines never heard
                  of the article, whatever it might be. And when they 
were finished the lady went and<span class="pb"> [PAGE 8] </span>smote 
the piano with an arm of might for about 38 minutes, after which the 
pair retired and were seen no more that night.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">That was the beginning of the row in 
our boarding-house.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Next morning the owner of the 
establishment came down early and refreshed herself with a few melodies 
before breakfast. She
                  was a strange, promiscuous, half-savage female, and 
was wont at times to get up before daybreak, and thud out all manner of
                  lost chords on the keyboard, and then she would keep 
time with her slippers and her head, and whirl her tangled locks in the
                  air, and cast the tails of her dressing-gown out 
behind her in a frenzy of inspiration. After that she would scuttle away
                  with a prodigious clatter, and clutch the sausages 
that were to be fried for breakfast, and for about half-an-hour the air
                  would be darkened with a chaos of food and dishes, and
 it would blow a gale of gravy, cruets, loaves, and similar properties.
                  When she entered with the breakfast-tray it always 
made me think of Napoleon's commissariat-department flying from Moscow,
                  for she generally arrived at a gallop, shoving 
one-half the provisions in front of her and dragging the other half 
behind,
                  and hissing to scare off the cat, which ran with its 
tail up in the rear of the procession, trying vainly to claw at the 
alleged
                  eatables.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then she would fling herself on the 
bell like a hash-house keeper possessed, and make a riot that was 
calculated to wake the
                  lost souls of all the dead boarders who had shuffled 
off this mortal coil, and were eating spectral ham and eggs in the 
fields
                  of asphodel. On this morning I found her leaping and 
gambolling on the stairs as usual, and I stopped to propound a solemn
                  question.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Mrs. Jones," I said sternly, "who are

               <p class="normal">"He's in the Gas-Office!" she replied 
in gasps, as she threw herself up against the air with the bell. 
"Newly-married! He's
                  English, and got £80 a year! I took them in at a 
reduced rate!"

               <p class="normal">"Oh, you did! Now, look here; have you 
any reason to suppose he's a duke or an emperor, or anything of the 
sort?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Do you suppose, as a respectable 
Christian woman, that he's got a castle anywhere?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No, I don't s'pose he has."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"<i>Did</i> he come in with the 
Conqueror, now?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"There wasn't anybody with him when he 
came in, that I saw."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"And did you know when you took them in
 that she was going to stick so far out of her clothes?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No, I DID N'T. If I'd knowed it I'd 
have throwed her out."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I went in to breakfast in a subdued 
mood. Johnson was there, looking with a shocked expression at the 
sausages, and shuddering
                  in a new bangle and a collar that was six times taller
 than the previous one. His wife, with a fresh bracelet, was glaring
                  at the same viand, and the expression in her eye 
seemed to say, "Where am I? Is this a horrid dream?" It was the only 
morning
                  in six months, too, when the sausages hadn't either 
fallen under the grate or been dropped on the stairs, and this made 
their
                  conduct all the more uncalled-for.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">At lunch-time Johnson's wife appeared 
in another fresh bracelet, and with a profusion of jewellery on her 
right forefinger.
                  And as for Johnson, astounding as it may seem, he had a
 third bangle on. Evidently he had one for each meal, and this was
                  his lunch-bangle.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">In the evening the lady had another 
silk dress on, and it exposed one knob more of her spine than her 
previous one. Johnson
                  wore his second clean collar and his dinner-bangle, 
and his small countenance, looming over his great expanse of 
shirt-front,
                  looked like a pallid bird of prey on the top of an icy
 mountain. They talked together in scraps of inferior French, and when
                  the meal was over Mrs. Johnson again smote the piano, 
and then retired coldly to her own apartments.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 10] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">That night we held an indignation 
meeting on the balcony. The landlady had deposited the vegetable-dish 
out there through
                  the window when she was getting ready to make her 
turbulent entry with the pudding, and had forgotten it Inside there were
                  two candles burning, and one lamp with a broken 
shade—the gas had been cut off for non-payment. The bread was in a plate
 on
                  top of the piano, and the dishes were in an unwashed 
condition downstairs, and the mistress of the house was singing a shrill
                  melody in the kitchen. And amid these surroundings 
Bem, the Polish tailor, passed a resolution that he would drive Johnson
                  off the premises, or die in the attempt. After that 
our souls felt relieved, and we settled down to placid harmony. Somebody
                  found some liquor in a bottle under his bed and 
brought it down. The cards were fished out, and we played Nap, and gave 
each
                  other I O U's on a lavish scale. The lamp flickered 
and went out with an awful smell. Then one of the candles died amid a
                  tremendous blob of grease, and we gave up playing, and
 smoked in the semi-darkness. The bread cast a long, gaunt shadow on
                  top of the piano, and the vegetable-dish was still 
forgotten on the balcony. And, finally, our landlady burst in with the
                  green dress partially open at the back, and wearing a 
hat decorated with six broken feathers; and fell over the cat in the
                  doorway; and played some tune that was all discords, 
on the piano, while Bem sang a dirge about some forgotten period when
                  he lived alongside a river, and went out musing with a
 female by moonlight. He was so moved by the recollection that he wept
                  into the last candle, and it went out also, leaving us
 in darkness.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I woke on that third morning with a 
vague and indefinable feeling that somebody had died in the night. There
 was a Sabbath
                  calm brooding over Jones's boarding-house which was 
quite foreign to that clamorous establishment, and as I listened it 
suddenly
                  occurred to me that Bem must have carried out his 
threat, and dynamited Johnson in the darkness. All the doors seemed to 
close
                  softly, instead of shutting with a soul-destroying 
bang as usual. The landlady flopped about gently on her trodden-down 
shoes,<span class="pb"> [PAGE 11] </span>instead of bringing in the 
breakfast with a crash and a shriek, and shedding dishes about in all 
directions; and she rang
                  the bell gently, whereas she usually rang it like a 
dray-load of escaped lunatics. I descended the stairs amid a prevailing
                  smell of ham and eggs, and went into the dining-room.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Johnson was breakfasting with a 
troubled expression and a bangle, and his wife was glaring across the 
table. Opposite them
                  Bem was solemnly feeding in evening dress. He looked 
absolutely vacant, and seemed to be lost in profound thought, and the
                  frantic excitement of the other eight boarders made no
 impression on him at all. He wore a pair of kid gloves and a bracelet,
                  and his moustache was elegantly waxed. Johnson rose at
 last, and walked round this apparition, but the apparition never moved.
                  Finally the Pole got up, and thoughtfully extracted an
 ancient, battered straw hat from under his chair, and, having jammed
                  it hard down on his head, he went out of the room and 
out of the house like a man who was lost in profound vacancy.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Nobody spoke. A species of paralysis 
seemed to have descended on that boarding-house. But, after a moment, 
Johnson rushed
                  on to the balcony and glared in a cataleptic fashion 
after this unaccountable visitant. And outside, on the stairs, stood
                  a petrified landlady, in a smudged green dress, and 
with a hat with six broken feathers in it cocked rakishly over one eye,
                  and two misfit shoes that seemed to have taken root in
 the floor. She held a teapot in one hand and a pie in the other, and
                  she was unconsciously pouring the tea into the pie, 
and the pie on to the staircase.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Bem turned up in the evening costume 
again at lunch-time, but, though expectation rose to fever-heat, nothing
 happened. Owing
                  to mental strain, however, the landlady fainted in the
 sink in the course of the afternoon.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">At dinner, the Johnsons began to show 
signs of wear and tear. Mrs. Johnson's left eyebrow was out of line, and
 her complexion
                  had shifted round to her ear. Evidently it had been 
put on with a<span class="pb"> [PAGE 12] </span>reckless hand, while the
 wearer was under the influence of considerable excitement. Her husband 
had an enraged and harassed
                  look, and his tie was off the straight, and his hair 
was crumpled. The landlady's shoes were in the hall, from which I 
gathered
                  that she had lost them in her agitation; and her hat 
was under the table. As for that joyous Bohemian herself, she was 
dodging
                  round in a semi-hysterical condition, and when I 
entered she had just given Johnson the whole dish of potatoes, and had 
shoved
                  the entire joint on another boarder's plate, after 
which she deposited the kettle in an abstracted manner on the 
tablecloth.
                  Then she fled unaccountably round the table and 
supplied us all with a number of other remarkable things too numerous 
aud
                  too badly assorted to mention. There was a dead and 
awful silence in the company—a silence that was too awful to be 
accounted
                  for on the supposition that Bem had appeared again in 
evening-dress and caused a panic. For one awful moment the thought 
occurred
                  to me that the insane Pole might possibly have 
appeared clothed in a marked scarcity of dress of any kind——
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He entered at that moment, carefully 
removing a shiny bell-topper as he came in, and depositing a pair of 
gloves in its inmost
                  recesses. He was attired in grey pants and a linen 
jacket, but he had taken the sleeves out of the jacket and out of his 
shirt,
                  and he was "cut low" at the neck. Also, he wore a gold
 bracelet—in fact, he was a remarkably good copy of Johnson's wife.
                  The landlady uttered a shriek when she saw him, and 
disappeared down the stairs. The cat escaped up the chimney, scattering
                  last night's dead ashes out of the grate as it went. 
The other boarders choked with insane glee, but Bem only contemplated
                  them for an instant with a lack-lustre eye and a 
funereal visage, and sat down. He was the one unmoved individual in the 
company.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then Johnson arose, and shaking a fork 
in the air with a palsied hand, he made a brief oration.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I give notice," he shrieked, "that I 
will leave this den of infamy at the end of this week. I am accustomed—I
 mean, I am
                  not accustomed—British constitution—degraded parody 
upon a<span class="pb"> [PAGE 13] </span>human being—I refuse to 
associate—dash and confound the—the—objectionable ruffian 
opposite—insolent outrage upon all gentlemanly
                  sentiment—gorilla on the other side of the table——"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He gave out there, and choked. With a 
wild howl he heaved up the table and capsized the ruins of it bodily at 
Bem, and then
                  he tramped heavily over the débris and engaged his 
enemy in mortal combat. The Pole emerged from the wreckage, and with his
                  hair full of gravy, and corned beef in both ears, and 
one eye stopped up with cabbage, and mustard streaming down his back,
                  he flew at Johnson like a wild cat. The candles went 
out; Mrs. Johnson shrieked in the passage; the landlady wailed dismally
                  in the kitchen; and all was horror and confusion.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">There was an item in Johnson's bill 
when he left, which read: "Broken crockery, 22s. 6d." I believe he 
hypothecated his lunch-bangle
                  to pay it. The gas has been turned on again since 
then, and the landlady sings weird songs to us in the gloaming, with her
                  hair down as of old. She wears the same green dress, 
and drops her shoes all over the house as before, but it isn't the same
                  landlady—the old one broke her neck on the stairs as 
beforementioned, and her daughter has inherited her clothes and the 
business,
                  and she rings the dinner-bell with even more vim than 
her lamented predecessor. She reminds me very much of her mother, for
                  she drops the meals on the stairs in a way that calls 
up sad, pathetic memories; and she rushes in as recklessly holding out
                  the gravy in front of her, and rushes out again as 
madly to look for the vegetables, as her deceased relative could have 
done.
                  Johnson is in gaol somewhere—there was a gap in his 
accounts which even his jewellery could not fill; and the wife has 
eloped
                  with our new landlady's husband, the printer. Also, 
nobody wears evening-dress at our boarding-house any more.

               John Reay Watson
               
               <p class="noindent">LOOKING toward his home, Moore caught
 a glimpse of light through the trees. It came from his wife's bedroom, 
most likely?
                  He wondered vaguely what would be her greeting. She 
had expected him to return in five weeks; it was exactly five hours 
since
                  she had waved good-bye to him from the wharf. He 
pondered without interest the question what she would have thought, and 
said,
                  and done, had the other steamer been moving just a 
little faster and sent them all to eternity.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He had expected to find the house in 
darkness. Yet where was the need to alter his pace? What did he gain by 
getting home
                  a minute sooner—say, before his wife put out her 
light? He would have to depict the scene of the collision for her; and 
he
                  was in the wrong mood for that. She would be full of 
wifely interest, womanly sympathy, about his share. Could a woman never
                  escape from her sex? Exalted to a position of mock 
heroism by his wife! In contemplation of the part marked for him he felt
                  that he could weep—tears of petulance.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The thought recurred—if it had ended 
otherwise, giving his wife the freedom to shape her course anew? A loss 
or gain to her?
                  Neither, in any great degree, he could answer. She 
would marry again; he could look calmly at that, with even a smile at 
his
                  inability to give distinct features to the figure his 
fancy conjured up as his successor. There was the boy—a different 
matter;
                  but as <i>he</i> had his father's blood in him, he 
could be left almost unconsidered; he would work out his own destiny.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">His wife was eight years younger—barely
 thirty; bright, clever, good-looking. One who met life gaily,—who, with
 a nature as
                  deep as anyone's, yet immersed herself in 
superficialities. An anomaly;<span class="pb"> [PAGE 15] </span>the 
centre of it hidden from him. Their natures were widely divergent; they 
were fettered together, yet trod separate paths.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Was that to be regretted? No; or at 
least in a very limited number of aspects. Their married life fell 
midway between happiness
                  and discontent, touching neither. Life to him was 
mostly on that plane.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Perhaps the one thing he regretted—if 
anything in life were serious enough to demand regret—was the fact of 
his marrying at
                  all. That had been a mistake; one among many; all the 
natural issue of the mistake of continuing to live. A world of error!
                  How could it be otherwise, when the right thing lay 
undecipherable amid a bewilderment of illusion?
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Looking up at the house, he noted that 
it was the drawing-room that was lighted—a matter that called for 
surprise; but he
                  was reluctant to confess to any. The drawing-room was 
seldom used at night, the dining-room downstairs being occupied as a
                  sitting-room. Only when visitors came in the 
evening—an unusual event—was it necessary to go upstairs.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He went to the back of the house and 
found it dark. The servants must have gone to bed, but that was denied 
in the fact of
                  visitors being present. They had gone out before the 
visitors came, and had not returned? Yet that seemed unlikely, since
                  the house was shut. He tried one door—to find it 
locked. Was it that his wife was alone, and feeling timid had locked up 
the
                  house before the servants came in? Then there were no 
visitors, and she was sitting by herself in the drawing-room—a change
                  from her ordinary habit, induced by her loneliness. 
Probably she had been at the piano. On this theory the seeming 
contradictions
                  were congruous and intelligible.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He was about to ascend the back stairs 
when he remembered that the key of one door had been lost a few days 
before. He turned
                  the handle and entered; darkness enveloped him. He 
walked carefully, so as not to startle his wife by any noise. He was 
fortunate
                  enough to find a clear passage, and reaching the foot 
of the stairs safely he began to ascend, keeping a hand on the 
balustrade.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 16] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">The silence of the house seemed an 
ominous thing; Moore caught himself stopping to listen to it. At the 
turning he halted;
                  his heart was beating strangely fast, his blood alert,
 as if expectant of something. He was visited by an outrageous thought.
                  "Was he in the wrong house?" He was about to consider 
the question, to sum up remembrance, when he heard a voice—pitched,
                  sustained, with a musical clearness in the sound—a 
man's voice. He was struck aghast—the thing was so contrary to anything
                  the circumstances made possible. He <i>was</i> awake, 
and in his own home. His mind ran back, but he found no rest for his 
thought; no haziness in his remembrance. A gleam
                  of light shot across the events of the day, revealing 
them to him in one immediate glance—distinct and in order, carrying
                  him to his presence there.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He had ascended to the top of the 
stairs, and his hand now encountered an overcoat. The touch of it sent a
 shock through him
                  that reduced him to material facts of life. He took up
 the hat that was on the stair-post, and, handling it, was vaguely glad
                  he could not name the owner. Neither did the voice 
help him to a guess, though he heard it more distinctly now—the voice of
                  a man reading aloud.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Why was his first conscious instinct a 
desire to escape—to descend the stairs and go out into the street till 
he could consider
                  what to do? Surely small consideration was necessary; 
his imperative duty lay before him, not behind. Was it that he felt
                  some charity towards his wife? Was it for <i>her</i> 
sake that he did not wish to come upon them? Or was it wholly a fear to 
take up his own part in the discovery; a fear that
                  had masked itself in subtle disguise?
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He had leaned back against the wall, 
but now stood up; he was in no need of support. But he could not calm 
his heart; his
                  blood tingled through his veins, giving him an odd 
sense of a new value in life—a value that deficient human senses could
                  not quite lay hold of. Existence seemed to promise 
something. A clear happiness when his present task was accomplished? He
                  asked himself the question.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 17] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">Looking up the corridor, he saw the ray
 of light that came through the drawing-room door. What was the scene 
that the door
                  hid from him? And what was the basis of the sudden, 
bitter prayer that it should close fast now, and, opening to no one's
                  effort, bury those two within walls? It was the 
awakening of the husband within him: he knew it, and felt it in a 
weakening
                  of his blood. He was no longer his old self, but one 
among a hundred; acting a part that had so often been acted before—the
                  meanest part that could be given to a high-minded man.
 In angry denial of such conception of himself—in attempt to shut it
                  out, he went up the passage.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The length appeared interminable, the 
noise of his walking was deafening, and the walls seemed to close in 
upon him as he
                  passed. Even at the threshold of the door he had a 
prompting that it was not too late to turn back; but he compressed his
                  lips and entered. A flood of warm light seemed to 
close around him. The fancy gave him strength; he became calmer; it was
                  as if he had been spiritually welcomed.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">In one glimpse he saw the pair; the 
noise of his footsteps had alarmed them; they stood separate, the first 
instinctive movement
                  of each had been towards an individual defence. The 
identity of the man gave no surprise; he was not able to be surprised,
                  more intense feelings finding place with him.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">It was Leston, a young doctor who had 
recently come to the town. He remembered, even at this turbulent moment,
 that he had
                  once remarked to his wife that Leston was distinctly a
 good-looking man; a judgment that she had not wholly acceded to. Was
                  this idle word the germinal cause of his present 
dishonour? The thing was almost worth enquiry. He could not recall that 
there
                  had been much intimacy between his wife and Leston. 
But then the husband is ever the last to see what is happening at his
                  side.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She was dressed in a pale blue 
tea-gown, a ribbon at her throat. He could think that this evening she 
must have looked remarkably
                  well, but now the deadly pallor and set cast of her 
features showed<span class="pb"> [PAGE 18] </span>only a mind in 
travail. She was standing behind a chair, her hands clasping the back of
 it.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She was small in stature, but carried 
herself well; her eyes gave a depth, her lips were finely cut, her face 
in every pose
                  showed the strength of fearlessness. Young, with good 
features and an abundance of dark brown hair, she was a woman who 
impressed
                  one with a sense of woman's witchery over man.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You!" she said quiveringly, almost as 
he entered. It seemed as if the word broke from her, before she was 
conscious of the
                  effort to speak.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He crossed over to the mantelpiece, 
and, resting one arm there, stood facing her. He could see that Leston 
was shifting his
                  gaze from one to the other, unknowing what to do, or 
what was to be done. The feverish excitement of his wife stirred an echo
                  in him; he endeavoured to steady his voice.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I have disturbed you," he said.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"It seems like it!" Her laughter rang 
out; recklessness, nervousness, echoing in the notes of it.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">She knew now that he had long suspected
 her; that his departure had been but a trick. He had come back to 
discover the thing
                  he looked for. In her feminine mind, the pitiful 
meanness of his manner of unmasking her—not to include the full success 
of
                  it—made him appear contemptible. For the moment, her 
sin was in some retrospective way justified by it; and she was conscious
                  of the vividness of the impression that she too gained
 in being no longer compelled to deceive. How much easier it was to
                  acknowledge guilt than it would have been to deny!
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Moore kept his eyes off Leston; he was 
aware of being more assured of the man's weakness than of his own 
strength. And his
                  wife would feel a keener shame in his looking to her 
as the only guilty one.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He addressed himself to her with gay 
pretence. "A friend of yours?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Could any man but he be so infamous as 
to amuse himself with her shame? Could he not see that the shame was 
partly his?<span class="pb"> [PAGE 19] </span>She would force him to 
feel it. "You can call him what you like."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"A lover, then?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">She had courted the word, yet her 
woman's nature felt a stab. "Lover!" It seemed to cry itself in the 
street, to be caught
                  on the wind, and carried echoing to the ears of the 
outer world. But she had compelled him to explicitly attack her. "You
                  have defined him—and yourself," she said.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"And also you."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Strange that she had not foreseen to 
what she would lay herself open. Was it that her mind was not capable of
 calm thought?
                  Must she acknowledge that she was not able to cope 
with him? She saw her woman's heart as the foundation of defeat. Was his
                  strength more than of manhood—an individual element in
 him? She felt suddenly that he could do as he willed with her; that
                  he could make her kneel to him; make her pitifully 
repentant. She saw the future and its threats against her; a word rang
                  in her brain that would not be driven out.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">In protest of finding herself at that 
depth, she looked at the man for whom she had sacrificed herself. But 
there was no help
                  for her there; he was younger, more hesitating than 
herself. In a flash she realised that she was more to blame than he; 
that
                  she had not less misshaped his life, than her own. 
Shiveringly she felt her isolation; a guilty woman at the mercy of the
                  world.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Moore watched her unflinchingly. He was
 surprised at the ease with which he had taken command of the situation;
 how calmly
                  he held it. A few moments before he had not known what
 to do, but now he could think coolly, see clearly. Victory was his,
                  even a kind of victory over Fate, who had prepared a 
situation in which he was to have been made to play a ridiculously 
pitiful
                  part.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He felt no pang in knowing he was a 
dishonoured husband, and endeavored to persuade himself that there was 
no reason why he
                  should feel one. But he was wise enough to know that 
his strength lay in contempt of the pair before him, in making them 
realise
                  themselves contemptible.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 20] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">"What is the book?" he asked, gazing at
 a volume that lay open on the floor where it had been dropped.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Does <i>that</i> interest you?" she 
said angrily.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Naturally. It has interested you."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"A loving husband!" She laughed 
scornfully—at herself and him.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You seem to regret something."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Our marriage?" she suggested.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"My God, woman, not half as much as I 
do—as I have done from the first."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He moved his arm, and accidentally 
upset a vase; it fell on the floor breaking into fragments. The noise 
resounded through
                  the house. To the woman's excited fancy it was a 
signal of something that was to happen; she looked to the door expecting
                  to see a terrifying shape take entrance. She listened,
 and afar off she thought she heard the faint tolling of a bell. Her
                  heart stopped, then beat to the tolling. She felt 
chilled to the blood.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Leston stood watching the scene before 
him with a weak resentment of his impotence. The fear that had first 
seized him had
                  in contemplation of the husband's calmness given place
 to a desire to assert himself, to claim a share in the guilt. It was
                  distinctly a situation that demanded a show of courage
 from him. Yet he was completely ignored. The tragedy which he had 
helped
                  to create was being played out without one thought of 
him. He chafed at the humiliation of his position, yet could not summon
                  the courage to escape from it.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Moore considered the import of the 
silence, then permitted himself to add, at a measured pace— "We both 
made a mistake. And
                  the issue—we have here. Well, even of that I can bear 
my part. But your part—I honestly pity."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She seemed heedless of all around; her 
eyes hung on the doorway expectantly. "I can do without it," she said 
pettishly.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I am aware of that, and I can easily 
understand it. You get rid of me, and you take in my place—this." He 
turned to<span class="pb"> [PAGE 21] </span>Leston, and the man shrank 
back ashamed. "A pretty boy, young enough to be educated to appreciate 
you."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Oh, stop! stop!" she cried.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">A child, barefooted and clad in a 
nightgown, stood hesitant at the door. He was about seven years old, and
 in features a likeness
                  of his father. The mother saw him, and called him to 
her with a look.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Moore followed her gaze, and knew then 
that it was not the sting of his words that had moved her, but only the 
fear of the
                  child understanding. "Frank!" he said sharply to the 
boy, "Come here!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Disobedience of that voice was 
impossible; he came like a dog.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Close the door—and take that chair."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The boy did his bidding, and then sat 
looking at his mother; his childish astonishment addressed to her.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The woman stood up with locked 
hands—supplicating, speechless.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You are not forbidden to look upon 
him," said Moore, coldly, in answer.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Send him away," she whispered, 
quiveringly.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"His proper place is here."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">She flung herself on the chair, in a 
passion of weeping, her soul given up to despair.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Father,——" began the boy.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Sit there, sir! Don't move till I tell
 you!" he was answered.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Leston crossed over and stood beside 
the woman; an opening was offered him. "For the child's sake, if not for
 hers, send him
                  away!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Moore laughed in contemptuous derision.
 "Surely <i>you</i> are imposing on your position!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I do not know about that, but you are 
cruelly imposing upon yours."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"If you dare to question me, by the 
living God I'll throw you over that balcony!" His violent utterance rang
 true, and the
                  echo of it, adding further excitement to his blood, 
made him dangerously apt to do what he threatened.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 22] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">"Don't speak to him!" said Mrs. Moore, 
in alarmed protest. "You do not know how passionate—— And you can do no 
good."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Leston, warm in offence, hated now to 
acknowledge to a physical fear. With his whole soul he longed for 
action. But for her
                  sake he must submit; and because he was so checked and
 hampered he began to look forward to escape. Yet honour compelled him
                  to stay.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"How long is this going to continue?" 
he said at length. "What are you going to do?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"There is nothing more for me to do; 
the rest falls on you!" The man's thought ran to dramatic utterance. Yet
 he had an educated
                  disdain of the stage.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What am <i>I</i> to do?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Leave this house at once—and take her 
with you." Moore was only outwardly calm; his strength had departed, and
 he knew that
                  he was physically ill. He feared that he could not 
maintain his part to the end. He wished they would hurry—a mad desire to
                  escape from the room had seized him.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Come, Lucy!" said Leston, bending over
 her. He wondered that he should so quietly accept the burden of her, 
though he knew
                  there was nothing else that he could do.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Her sobs had ceased; she sat with her 
face hidden, giving no sign that she heard.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Lucy!" It was an appeal to her to look
 up, so that he might read the reason of her unwillingness.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">She jumped up quickly, and, throwing 
herself out of his embracing arms, staggered against a small desk that 
stood by the wall,
                  and halted with her back to it.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No, I will not go!" she cried. "Not 
though he orders it. I stay here—my place is here. I could not go with 
you. How could
                  you think of it! It would mean——" She turned quickly 
to her husband. "Can I stay? Only till to-morrow. See, I ask it; on my
                  knees, if I must."
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 23] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">"You can do as you will," he said, 
simply. "I will offer no objection now."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">She turned to Leston, speaking from a 
centre that was hidden from him. "You can go."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"But you!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Go!" she commanded.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He made his pitiful departure. Moore 
felt an infinite relief; he sat down weariiy in a chair, his face turned
 from her.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">She saw the depth of his despair, and 
her heart moved madly—responsive to her thoughts. Her fault rose up 
behind her, threatening
                  to advance and overwhelm her—a purpose beckoned her to
 escape.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Will you put Frank to bed?" She spoke 
quietly; a new strength had been given her.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He looked up in surprise. The fact of 
having to be told by her what he must do was a shock to him. He saw how 
far beneath
                  command of himself he had sunk, but he made no effort 
to recover.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yes," he said.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The child followed him, nervous, crying
 pitifully, and was the more abandoned in his tears that he knew not 
very definitely
                  why he should cry.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">In quieting him, Moore promised that 
his mother would not leave him; that she would not be permitted. He 
attempted to persuade
                  himself that though he had lost a wife, he had no 
right to deprive the child of a mother. He felt happier in such a 
thought,
                  though he knew he was but juggling with his mind.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The soft promises he had to make to the
 boy helped to soothe himself as well. But he saw no course of action, 
nor what in
                  honour he could offer her.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He went back to the drawing-room, 
possessed of a full indifference. He himself was under no necessities. 
Fate could do with
                  him as it would. Or his wife could decide what was to 
be; he would stand aside, offering no opposition to either.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You have come back," she said. "I 
hoped you would." He acquiesced dully and stood by the doorway. He had a
 horror of<span class="pb"> [PAGE 24] </span>taking up his old position 
by the mantelpiece. The woman read a hatred of coming near to her.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He had leisure to notice her; to see 
that her face paled and flushed, that her eyes were luminously bright. 
She stood as when
                  he had left her, yet her attitude seemed constrained.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He had to break through a silence. 
"What is it you want with me?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Nothing. Unless——"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Well?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"To hear your reproaches."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Lucy!" He reproached her levity.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">She laughed defiantly, but her laughter
 rang hollow. "Tell me how much you despise me," she said. "How much you
 hate me! Do!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"How much I pity you; how much I pity 
us both!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Oh, Harry! Not that," she said with a 
shiver. "Do not conquer me! Be harsh! Treat me as I deserve! Why don't 
you hate me?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Say because Frank does n't. He will 
not let his mother leave him; I had to promise that she would not."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">She looked long in silence; as if she 
could not credit him. Her breath came in short gasps. Not till he again 
glanced up at
                  her did she find utterance. "The poor child—the 
darling! And I—my pride in him should have saved me. I wonder why it did
 not?
                  I have been mad this last month—not myself. Oh, the 
horror of it now!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Will you stay?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You had to promise him, you say. That 
was cruelly hard on you."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I have not said that. Will you stay?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He was aware that he was offering her 
all that was in his heart; and more than was in his mind. He knew not 
where he stood.
                  His head swam; the walls of the room seemed to recede,
 then halt and come slowly back. He looked up—to see his wife fall 
forward
                  on her face.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 25] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">He ran to her, and knelt beside her, 
his mind in the travail of unshaped fears. He lifted her in his arms and
 turned her face
                  towards him.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Lucy, what is it! You are ill! You 
have hurt yourself!" A convulsion seized her, and left her with her 
features set in distortion.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You would take me back?" she 
whispered.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"For his sake."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Ah, yes," she sighed. She held a 
pause, then asked—"Not for my own?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">His face hardened; she asked more than 
he could give her.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Let me go!" she cried. "Do not hold 
me! How can you when you hate me so?" Her violence carried her out of 
his arms, and she
                  stopped at a distance from him.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I do not hate you, Lucy. You know I 
don't. But I cannot pretend that I have forgiven you."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I did not ask for that; I only 
meant—but it does n't matter. It is best that it should end now."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"End, Lucy?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Can't you see?" she cried fiercely.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He caught an inspiration from her tone;
 an infinite horror surged through him. "Lucy! have you poisoned 
yourself?" He made
                  a step towards her.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Don't come near me!" she screamed, 
raising herself on her hands. "I will not let you touch me!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Lucy!" Horror held him in its embrace;
 he was capable only of a weak utterance of her name.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Listen!" she cried excitedly. "Frank 
is calling me. You hear him? Let me go to him!" She looked up for 
permission, as he
                  stood senselessly watching her.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Do not follow me!" she said. "Let me 
go alone. I must see him before——"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">She staggered to her feet, and, 
reaching the doorway, steadied herself there and went down the passage.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The child was crying upon the bed; her

 Charley's Good Little Wife.</h4>
               Louis Becke
               
               <p class="noindent">THERE was the island, only ten miles 
away, and there it had been for a whole week. Sometimes we got near 
enough to see Long
                  Charley's house and the figures of natives walking on 
the yellow beach; and then the westerly current would take us away to
                  leeward again. But that night a squall came up, and in
 half-an-hour we were running down to the land. When the lights on the
                  beach showed up we hove-to until daylight, and then 
found the surf too heavy to let us land.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">We got in close to the reef, and could 
see that the trader's copra-house was full, for there were hundreds of 
bags outside,
                  awaiting our boats. It was clearly worth staying for. 
The trader, a tall, thin, pyjama-clad man, came down to the water's
                  edge, waved his long arm, and then turned back and sat
 down on a bag of copra. We went about and passed the village again,
                  and once more the long man came to the water's edge, 
waved his arm, and retired to his seat.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">In the afternoon we saw a native and 
Charley together among the bags; then the native left him, and, as it 
was now low tide,
                  the kanaka was able to walk to the edge of the reef, 
where he signalled to us. Seeing that he meant to swim off, the skipper
                  went in as close as possible, and backed his 
fore-yard. Watching his chance for a lull in the still fierce breakers, 
the native
                  slid over the reef and swam out to us as only a Line 
Islander or a Tokelau man can swim.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"How's Charley?" we asked, when the 
dark man reached the deck.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Who? Charley? Oh, he fine! plenty 
copra. T?p?! my bowels are filled with the sea—for one dollar! Here <i>ariki
 vaka</i> (captain) and you <i>tubi tubi</i> (supercargo)," said the 
native, removing<span class="pb"> [PAGE 28] </span>from his perforated 
and pendulous ear-lobe a little roll of leaf, "take this letter from the
 mean one that giveth but a dollar
                  for facing such a <i>galu</i> (surf). Hast plenty 
tobacco on board, friends of my heart? Ap?, the surf! Not a canoe crew 
could the white man get to face
                  it. Is it good twist tobacco, friends, or the flat 
cakes? Know that I am a man of Nanomea, not one of these dog-eating 
people
                  here, and a strong swimmer; else the letter had not 
come."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The supercargo took the note. It was 
rolled up in many thicknesses of banana-leaf, which had kept it dry:—</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Dear Friends,—I have Been waiting for 
you for near 5 months. I am Chock full of Cobberah and Shark Fins one 
Ton. I am near

Enything to Eat. for god's Saik send me a case of Gin ashore if you

CHARLES."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">We parcelled a bottle of gin round with
 a small coir line, and sent it ashore by the Nanomea man. Charley and a
 number of
                  natives came to the edge of the reef to lend a hand in
 landing the bearer of the treasure. Then they all waded back to the
                  beach, headed by the white man in the dirty pyjamas 
and sodden-looking <i>fala</i> hat. Reaching his house he turned his 
following away and shut the door.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I bet a dollar he wouldn't swap 
billets with the angel Gabriel at this partickler moment," said the 
profane mate, thoughtfully.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">We started weighing and shipping the 
copra next day. After finishing up, the solemn Charley invited the 
skipper and supercargo
                  to remain ashore till morning. His great trouble, he 
told us, was that he had not yet secured a wife, "a reg'lar wife, 
y'know."
                  He had, unluckily, "lost the run" of the last Mrs. 
Charley during his absence at another island of the group, and 
negotiations
                  with various local young women had been broken off 
owing to his having run out of trade. In the South Seas, as in Australia
                  and elsewhere, to get the girl of your heart is 
generally a mere matter of trade. There were, he told us with a 
melancholy
                  look, "some fine Nukunau girls here on a visit, but 
the one I want don't seem to care much about stayin', unless all this
                  new trade fetches her."

               <p class="normal">"Who is she?" inquired the skipper.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Tib?kw?'s daughter."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Let's have a look at her!" said the 
skipper, a man of kind impulses, who felt sorry at the intermittency of 
the Long One's
                  connubial relations.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The tall, scraggy trader shambled to 
the door and bawled out "Tib?kw?, Tib?kw?, Tib?kw?, O!" three times.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The people singing in the big <i>moniep</i>
 or town-house stopped their monotonous droning, and the name of Tib?kw?
 was yelled vociferously throughout the village in
                  true Gilbert Group style. In the Gilberts, if a native
 in one corner of a house speaks to another in the opposite corner,
                  he bawls loud enough to be heard a mile off.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Tib?kw? (The Shark) was a short, squat 
fellow, with his broad back and chest scored and seamed with an 
intricate and inartistic
                  network of cicatrices made by shark's-teeth swords. 
His hair, straight, coarse and jet-black, was cut away square from just
                  above his eyebrows to the top of his ears, leaving his
 fierce countenance in a sort of frame. Each ear-lobe bore a load—one
                  had two or three sticks of tobacco, twined in and 
about the distended circle of flesh, and the other a clasp-knife and 
wooden
                  pipe. Stripped to the waist, he showed his muscular 
outlines to perfection, and he sat down unasked in the bold, 
self-confident,
                  half-defiant manner natural to the Line Islander.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Where's Tirau?" asked the trader.</p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 30] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">"Here," said the man of wounds, 
pointing outside, and he called out in a voice like the bellow of a 
bull—"<i>Tirau O, nako mai!</i>" (Come here!)
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Tirau came in timidly, clothed only in a
 <i>ridi</i> or girdle, and slunk into a far corner.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The melancholy trader and the father 
pulled her out, and she dumped herself down in the middle of the room 
with a muttered
                  "<i>E pu?k?k? te matan!</i>" (Bad white man!)
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Fine girl, Charley," said the skipper,
 digging him in the ribs. "Ought to suit you, eh! Make a good little 
wife."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Negotiations commenced anew. Father 
willing to part, girl frightened—commenced to cry. The astute Charley 
brought out some
                  new trade. Tirau's eyes here displayed a faint 
interest. Charley threw her, with the air of a prince, a whole piece of 
turkey
                  twill, twelve yards—value three dollars, cost about 
2s. 3d. Tirau put out a little hand and drew it gingerly toward her. 
Tib?kw?
                  gave us an atrocious wink.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"She's cottoned!" exclaimed Charley.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">And thus, without empty and hollow 
display, were two loving hearts made to beat as one. As a practical 
proof of the solemnity
                  of the occasion, the bridegroom then and there gave 
Tirau his bunch of keys, which she carefully tied to a strand of her <i>ridi,</i>
 and, smoking one of the captain's Manilas, she proceeded to bash out 
the mosquitoes from the nuptial couch with a fan. We
                  assisted her, an hour afterwards, to hoist the 
sleeping body of Long Charley therein; and, telling her to bathe his 
head in
                  the morning with cold water, we turned to go.
               </p>

 The Land."</h4>
               Henry Fletcher
               
               <p class="noindent">HOT! A blistering heat, that drove 
the fowls, with their beaks gaping, off the burning ground into the 
shelter of the slab
                  hut. A scorching, withering heat, that had made 
sapless hay of the grass in the paddocks, and reddened the foliage of 
the
                  gums and the stringy-barks as they would have been 
reddened by the blaze of a bush-fire. A heat that had sucked up all 
moisture,
                  and marbled the land with cracks of shrinkage, and 
turned the waterholes into mere mud-baths; while the distant creek had
                  nothing but its brown flag-grass and dry swampy bed to
 show where the water had flowed.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">About the homestead, the few cattle 
still alive hung with their heads stolidly over the slip-rails, 
refusing, in spite of
                  all driving, to seek again for the sustenance it was 
impossible to find. The frame-work of a horse, his head between his 
legs,
                  and as much in shade as he could get on the lee side 
of an old ironbark, stood impassive and motionless. All round the 
horizon,
                  a dirty haze of smoke, that melted into a yellow veil 
of fog covering the sky.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The sun glared down. The air shimmered 
tremulously, as though it sickened with its burden. And over all that 
land not one
                  gleam of freshness, not one sound of joy, not a murmur
 save the eternal zing-zing-zing of the locust. Seared, blasted, 
stricken,
                  a curse upon it and upon every living thing.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Abe Saunders was down at what used to 
be the creek, trying to drag out his last milking cow from the place 
where she had bogged
                  in a vain effort to find water-grass.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Abe hauled and strained at the rope, 
his shirt and trousers clinging to him with sweat. The beast kicked and 
plunged feebly,<span class="pb"> [PAGE 32] </span>its little strength 
quite gone; and after two hours' work it was more firmly bogged than 
ever.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"It's no good," said Abe, "I must get 
help; I'll go up the gully for old Mason and his tackle. If we lose that
 cow, what will
                  the children do for milk?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Wearily he turned to go, when the sound
 of a "Coo-ee!" turned him sharply about.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Coo-ee!" he shouted.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">A little pause, and again the cry 
echoed.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Coo-ee!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"It's Mary," he said; "what the devil's
 up?" It was a good three miles to the ridge; but, like a wallaby with 
the dogs in
                  full cry, he sped over rock and gully back to the 
homestead. Long before he got there, he heard a strange roaring in the 
air,
                  saw black, belching clouds over the tree tops, and 
felt a fierce rushing furnace beneath.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The bush was on fire.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">With the energy of fear he dashed 
along. There was the clearing, with Mary at the house-door still 
shouting at intervals.
                  Even as he came up, the red storm was upon them. In 
mad frenzy he seized the two children, one under each arm, and shrieking
                  to his wife above the din of the fire to bring the 
baby, he rushed to the centre of the ploughed paddock. There they 
crouched
                  panting. The children were howling, the baby was 
crying, and Mary was sobbing. The man said nothing. He watched the fire.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Would the house escape? There was fifty
 feet of bare ground all about it. But the air, so calm a minute ago, 
was now a roaring
                  hurricane travelling at racing speed over the ridge. 
The tea-tree scrub melted before it, and the bush trees remained in its
                  rear only as black and burning trunks. The fence had 
caught; the flames licked it up daintily. The shed, with his cart and
                  harness, stood, and was gone, while he looked. A piece
 of burning stringy-bark, whirled by the wind, settled on the shingles
                  of the house. The woman moaned and pressed the child 
closer to her bosom. The man's face was drawn in agony.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 33] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">Week by week, day by day, he had seen 
the work of his life perish under the merciless sun. The best of his 
cattle were festering
                  carcasses; his horses were dead, though his last pound
 had been spent in hay for them. His season's crop was sickly beyond
                  redemption. All this he had borne, and still toiled on
 in the unequal struggle.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">And now the house was burning, the work
 of his own hands. How many months of weary sawing and splitting had its
 shingles and
                  slabs cost him? He thought of it all as he stood 
there, helpless and half-suffocated. In less than a minute the flames 
were
                  shooting out of the doorways and windows, and a loud 
report was followed by the fall of a side of the house. It was the 
explosion
                  of his powder-flask, hung on the wall.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Can't you put it out, Abe?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Put out hell!" And he ground his 
teeth.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Through the open frame-work they could 
see the bed, the table, the chairs all blazing one after another. The 
spirit of the
                  man revolted.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Look, Mary!" he cried, "there goes the
 cradle I made for the kids." And as he spoke the aspect of his face 
changed. The limit
                  of his suffering had come, and, like an old-time 
victim of the rack, he began to laugh. A hollow laugh, weird and 
terrible.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"That's a good joke, Mary! The farce is
 ended—all over in one act! Ha, ha, ha!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You're mad, Abe!" said his wife, 
shrinking from him, with a great dread in her eyes. "Don't laugh like 
that. It's horrible!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Mad, my dear! That's good. Ha, ha, ha!
 Say I've been mad—the most confounded lunatic in this blasted, 
blistering country.
                  To slog and belt for ten long years to make a home of 
our own; to clear land, to fence it, drain it, plant it—and all to make
                  five minutes' bonfire! Yes, I've been mad—stark, 
staring mad; but now—ha, ha, ha!—I was never so sensible in my life!
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"See how the cradle burns, Mary! It was
 a bit of she-oak, and worked like a watch. Doesn't it look pretty 
now?—they might
                  be silk curtains, all those flounces round it! Why 
don't you laugh,<span class="pb"> [PAGE 34] </span>girl?—it's a great 
joke. Look! the roof is falling in. It's as good as fireworks. Hold up 
the kids; let them laugh! It's all
                  the same price. Ha, ha, ha!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">But the woman replied nothing, 
frightened, staring at him. The children screamed.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The driving sheet of flame had long 
gone by. Skirting the ploughed ground where they stood, it had left the 
bare surface an
                  untouched blank in its ghastly funeral trail. Only 
tree-stumps, posts, and fallen branches smoked and smouldered here and
                  there. The man stood motionless till nothing remained 
of his home but the four charred corner-posts.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Let's see the play out!" he said. "Ha,
 ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The fire was raging many miles further 
onward when Abe Saunders, taking the two children by the hand, led the 
way down the
                  track to the main road. His wife dragged wearily after
 him, the baby in her arms, looking back from time to time at the 
smoking
                  ruin.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The group passed on to the road, where 
the red dust blew in thick, choking clouds that shrouded them from view.
 But long after
                  they had disappeared there sounded the wail of the 
children, the moaning of the woman, and loud above all the mirthless 
laughter
                  of a broken-hearted man.

 Parson's Black-Boy.</h4>
               Ernest Favenc
               
               <p class="noindent">The Rev. Joseph Simmondsen had been 
appointed by his Bishop to a cure of souls in the Far North, in the days
 when Queensland
                  was an ungodly and unsanctified place. Naturally, the 
Rev. J., who was young, green, and zealous, saw a direct mission in
                  front of him. His predecessor had never gone twenty 
miles outside the little seaport that formed the commercial outlet of
                  the district; but this did not suit Joseph's eager 
temperament. Once he felt his footing and gained a little experience, he
                  determined on a lengthened tour that should embrace 
the uttermost limits of his fold.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Now, although beset with the conceit 
and priggishness inseparable from the early stages of parsonhood, 
Simmondsen was not
                  a bad fellow, and glimpses of his manly nature would 
at times peep out in spite of himself. This, without his knowledge, 
ensured
                  him a decent welcome; and he got a good distance 
inland under most favourable auspices, for, the weather being fine, 
everybody
                  was willing to lend him a horse or drive him along to 
the next station upon his route. The Rev. Joseph began to think that
                  the roughness of the back country had been much 
exaggerated.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">In due course he arrived at a station 
which we will call Upton Downs; beyond it there were only a few 
newly-taken-up runs.
                  On Upton Downs they were busy mustering, and when the 
parson enquired about his way for the next day the manager looked rather
                  puzzled. "You see," he said, "we are rather 
short-handed, and I can't spare a man to send with you; at the same time
 the track
                  from here to Gundewarra is not very plain, and I am 
afraid you might not be able to follow it. However, I will see what I
                  can do."
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 36] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">Mr. Simmondsen was retiring to rest 
that night when a whispered conversation made itself audible in the next
 room. No words
                  were distinguishable, but from the sounds of smothered
 laughter a good joke seemed to be in progress.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I think I can manage for you," said 
the manager at breakfast next morning. "When you leave here you will go 
to Gundewarra,
                  25 miles. From there it is 35 miles to Bilton's Camp, 
and 10 on to Blue Grass. From Blue Grass you can come straight back
                  here across the bush, about 40 miles. I will lend you a
 blackboy who knows the country well and will see you round safely."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The young clergyman thanked his host, 
and, after breakfast, prepared to leave. The blackboy, a good-looking 
little fellow
                  arrayed in clean moles and twill shirt, was in 
attendance with a led pack-horse, and the two departed.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">For some miles the Reverend Joseph 
improved the occasion by a little pious talk to the boy, who spoke 
fairly good English,
                  and showed a white set of teeth when he laughed, as he
 constantly did at everything the parson said. At midday they camped
                  for an hour on the bank of a lagoon, in which Mr. 
Simmondsen had a refreshing swim. In the evening they arrived at their 
destination,
                  and received the usual welcome.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I see you adapt yourself to the 
customs of the country," said his host at mealtime, and a slight titter 
went round the table.
                  The Rev. Joseph joined in, taking it for granted that 
his somewhat unclerical garb was alluded to. In reply to enquiries he
                  was informed that Bilton's Camp was a rough place, and
 Blue Grass even worse; and he was pleased to hear it, for until then
                  his path had been too pleasant altogether; he hadn't 
had a chance to reprove anybody.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Bilton's Camp proved to be indeed a 
rough place. The men were civil, however, and as the parson had taken 
another exhilarating
                  bath at the midday camp he appreciated the rude fare 
set before him; although here, as at the other place, there seemed to
                  be a joke floating about that made everybody snigger.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The next day's journey, to Blue Grass, 
was but a short stage, and as the reverend gentleman had by this time 
become very<span class="pb"> [PAGE 37] </span>friendly with Charley, the
 blackboy, the two rode along chatting pleasantly until they came 
somewhat unexpectedly on the new
                  camp.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">A very greasy cook and two or three 
gins in dilapidated shirts were the only people at home, and they stood 
open-eyed to greet
                  the stranger.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Although Mr. Simmondsen had suited his 
attire to his surroundings, he still retained enough of the clerical 
garb to signify
                  his profession. The cook, therefore, at once took in 
the situation, and invited the parson under the tarpaulin which did 
temporary
                  duty as a hut.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He informed his visitor, at whom he 
looked rather curiously, that "everyone" was away, camped out, and that 
no one would return
                  for a couple of days; that he was alone, excepting for
 two men who were at work in a yard a short distance off, and who would
                  be in to dinner;—in fact, they came up while he was 
speaking. Mr. Simmondsen took great interest in this, the first real 
"outside"
                  camp he had seen; and as the two bushmen had gone down
 to the creek for a wash, and the cook was busy preparing a meal, he
                  called Charley to ask him a few questions.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What are these black women doing about
 the place, Charley?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"O! all about missus belongah 
whitefellow," was the astonishing reply.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">It was some moments before Joseph could
 grasp the full sense of this communication; then he considered it his 
duty to read
                  these sinners a severe lecture, and prepared one 
accordingly.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Do you not understand," he said, when 
the three men were together, "the trespass you are committing against 
both social and
                  Divine laws? If you do not respect one, perhaps you 
will the other."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The cook stared at the bushmen in blank
 amazement, and the bushmen at the cook.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I allude to these unfortunate and 
misled beings," said the parson, waving his hand towards the half-clad 
gins.</p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 38] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">A roar of laughter was the reply. 
"Blest if that doesn't come well from <i>you!</i>" said the cook, when 
he could speak. The others chuckled in acquiescence.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What do you mean?" said the indignant 
Joseph; "I speak by right of my office."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Sit down and have some tucker," said 
the cook, "you're not a bad sort, I can see; but don't come the blooming
 innercent!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The indignant pastor refused. He saw 
that his words were treated lightly, that no one would listen to him, 
and he left in
                  high dudgeon. Charley had told him that there was a 
good lagoon about twelve miles on the road back to Upton Downs; he would
                  go on there and camp—they had plenty of provisions on 
the pack-horse—and taking his bridle and calling the boy he went to
                  catch his horse.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">As he came back he overheard the 
fag-end of a remark the cook was making to the others. "They came round 
the end of the scrub
                  chatting as thick as thieves, and when I seed who it 
was—Lord! you could have wiped me out with one hand."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">This was worse than Greek to the Rev. 
Joseph. Greek he might have understood. In spite of a humble apology 
from the delinquent,
                  he departed, and near sundown arrived at the lagoon 
Charley had spoken of. It was a lovely spot. One end was thick with 
broad-leaved
                  water-lilies, but there was a clear patch at the other
 end promising the swim the good parson enjoyed so much.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">When the tent was pitched he stood in 
Nature's garb about to enter the water, when Charley called to him. 
Pointing towards
                  the lilies, he told Mr. Simmondsen that he would get 
him some seed-pods which the blacks thought splendid eating. The 
clergyman
                  had only got up to his waist when he heard a plunge 
behind him and saw Charley's dark form half splashing, half swimming 
towards
                  the lilies. Presently his head emerged from a dive, 
and he beckoned towards the clergyman to come over and taste the 
aboriginal
                  luxury. The Rev. Joseph paddled lazily over and 
investigated. The seedpods proved of very pleasant flavour, and as the 
sun
                  was nearly down, Mr. Simmondsen wended his way to the 
bank and emerged in the<span class="pb"> [PAGE 39] </span>shallow water,
 with Charley a few paces behind him. For some reason he looked back. 
Shocking predicament! There was no shirking
                  the fact; all the quiet laughter about "the customs of
 the country," the unexplained allusions, the ribald manner of the cook,
                  were intelligible in a flash. Charley was a woman!
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The wicked manager of Upton Downs had 
started him on his travels with ("after the custom of the country") a 
black gin dressed
                  in boy's clothes as a valet, and that gin evidently 
had been recognised by everyone on the road. Mr. Simmondsen thought of
                  the past and blushed. That night was spent in fervent 
prayer.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"My dear sir," said Davis, the super. 
of Upton Downs, "I did the best I could for you. Charlotte is as good as
 any blackboy,
                  and knows all the country round here. Now, own up, 
didn't she look after you well?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You forget the scandal that may 
arise," said the Rev. Joseph Simmondsen.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Lord, man! who cares about what is 
done out here? Nobody will ever hear of it."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Davis was wrong. Everybody did hear of 
it. The Rev. Simmondsen received indignant letters from his Bishop, his 
church-wardens,
                  several missionary societies, and, last and worst, a 
letter of eternal farewell from the young lady to whom he was engaged
                  to be married. Fortunately he inherited some money at 
the time, so he did the best thing possible—threw up the church, went
                  into squatting, and is now one of the most popular men
 in this district.

               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 40] </span><h4 class="normal">Esther.</h4>
               J. J. O'Meara
               
               <p class="noindent">ESTHER was a frail little girl, with a
 face so thin and wan that the freckles seemed to have fallen like a 
merciful veil upon
                  it. She was not pretty. Her hair was too short to 
plait, not long enough to hang gracefully loose, and its fibre was 
altogether
                  too contrary for curls. So it hung miserably about her
 ears, ragged and tattered like the remnant of a flag that might have
                  issued from the fire and smoke of battle.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She was a friendless orphan, which fact
 made her a born servant to somebody. Old Mrs. MacSmith had secured her 
services from
                  the State when she first began to toddle on two 
legs—two legs that soon became bowed under the pots and pans she had to 
carry
                  in her small arms—and next to her heart.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Thenceforth the MacSmith household was 
perpetually in a state of war. Her mistress beat her. Esther screamed, 
and fought fiercely.
                  But Mrs. MacSmith had a duty to perform. So she would 
grip the little rebel by the windpipe, and call for "Mac." He always
                  came, swift and sure, and the enemy was routed.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Thus, for all the eight years of her 
life, Esther's existence had been one of screams and pain. She was such a
 bold, bad girl,—a
                  mere handful, but with a stubborn heart, primed so 
full of foolish courage that it must surely have burst, were it not for
                  the vent-pipes that relieved the pressure when Esther 
called people names, and wouldn't work, and scratched the collective
                  face of the MacSmith family with finger-nails kept 
sharp for that purpose. And she had two other safety-valves to her 
feelings.
                  One was to laugh hysterically when, for exhibition 
purposes, she was expected to cry; and the other was to sob 
heart-breakingly
                  when someone<span class="pb"> [PAGE 41] </span>tried 
to cheer her with a kind word. Mr. Giles, the parson, once said of her:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"A regular passion-flower, my dear; but
 not quite so pretty." A simile so vague that Esther resentfully poked 
out her tongue.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The MacSmith family had only one 
greeting to bestow—"You little wretch!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The canker grew in Esther's heart. At 
times, she stole in through the window of the empty cottage next door, 
and, alone and
                  unobserved, began talking to herself. It was the one 
little sociable break in her martyrdom.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Why don't I die?" she asked herself 
once.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">She was eating a green apple. She took 
another bite, and swallowed it.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"That's why," she said. "Because I'm a 
greedy-guts."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">And then, after a pause, and looking 
wistfully at the cold fire-place, she added:</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Oh, I do wish I didn't eat!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Why don't I run away?" was the next 
question.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">She waxed violent at this.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Because I'm a looney; and here goes 
for squashing old Mother MacSmith, anyway." She brought down the heel of
 her boot on
                  a large black spider, creeping on the floor.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"That's forty-three times I've killed 
her now!" she commented, surveying the remains with satisfaction. "And 
it was twice
                  a frog, and once a mary-bug." She laughed shrilly. 
"Oh, I'll kill her yet," she added.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The helpless buzzing of a fly, caught 
in a spider's web, came from a corner. Esther investigated. She killed 
the spider, and
                  threw the rescued fly out of the window.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Soon after this the cottage found a 
tenant. Mr. and Mrs. Mullampy, a pair newly wed, brought in their 
furniture.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Their honeymoon had been a very nice 
luminary while it lasted. The cheers of their friends, and the rice, and
 the proverbial
                  old<span class="pb"> [PAGE 42] </span>shoe, had given 
them entrance to married life with quite a violent propulsion. But the 
law of gravitation told, and they slowed
                  down. Then the rainbow lost the glory of its tints; 
the mantle of chimney-smoke fell on their air-castles; and they 
themselves
                  came right down to the bed-rock of the prosaic. When 
they couldn't get down any further they commenced to argue. Then the
                  price of meat went up; the milkman began to call 
regularly; and married life on a solid basis had begun.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Esther took a great interest in their 
arguments. Tiptoeing her way on to the very threshold of the Mullampys' 
kitchen at meal-time,
                  she would listen attentively. And she learnt many 
things. She found that she was not the only unhappy person in the world.
                  Once she saw the husband lift his hand to strike his 
wife. "Don't!" Esther screamed. The hand was arrested. Esther ran away.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">After that, the child's presence came 
to be one of the subconscious details of their domestic dramas. Nor did 
they resent
                  it. In their inmost hearts they felt that Esther's 
shadow, falling athwart the doorway, was to them Love's decoy-bird, a 
creature
                  swaying them with such a strange influence that more 
than once the man was tempted to crush his pride and call the child in
                  to plead for a kiss with the woman he really loved. 
And the woman, being weaker, could not keep the pain out of her eyes.
                  Yet she, too, was very proud.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Often, in the midst of bitter 
recrimination, the husband would suddenly stop short and glance 
fearfully at the door. Esther's
                  ragged head would pop quickly back, and the man, with 
increased colour, would get up awkwardly from the table and vanish 
through
                  the opposite doorway.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">On one of these occasions, when the 
husband had left the room, Esther dropped something heavily on the 
floor. Mrs. Mullampy
                  looked up from the table, and her visitor, looking 
very red and guilty, advanced towards her. In one hand, which hung limp
                  and passive by her side, a large horse-shoe dangled.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 43] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">"Whatever do——"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Please, don't; I know I'm wicked."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What's that for?" Mrs. Mullampy 
pointed at the horse-shoe.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"'Cos if I don't tell no lies I won't 
go to heaven," said Esther, a little mixed, and trying to nerve herself,
 in a roundabout
                  way, for a momentous admission. She drew a long 
breath.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"<i>To brain him with,</i> please!" she
 said.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Who?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"<i>Him.</i> 'Cos he wanted to hit 
you."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Mrs. Mullampy looked at her in silence 
for a while. Esther hated to be pitied. She gave her head a proud toss, 
calculated
                  to change the compassionate expression of the woman's 
eyes.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I hate him!" she said, spitefully. She
 tossed her head again. This time two gum-leaves and a twig dropped from
 her tangled
                  hair to the floor.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"My dear child!" the woman said, 
softly.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Esther's lip quivered. Then she thought
 of the spider she had killed on the very spot where she was standing. 
The recollection
                  made her more cheerful. Mrs. Mullampy picked up the 
horse-shoe.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Would you hit <i>me</i> with this, 
Esther?" she asked.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The child shook her head.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Well, then, don't hit <i>him!</i> If 
you do, you'll hit me."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Esther's mouth opened wide.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"'Tain't a boomerang like Joe 
MacSmith's," she said, sharply.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Mrs. Mullampy made an impatient 
gesture. She bit her lip, as though restraining an exclamation.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You don't understand," she said.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">A sweet temptation came over her, and 
she lifted the child on to her knees, and with all the patience of a 
loving teacher
                  commenced to explain. She outpoured the long pent-up 
secrets of her heart to Esther Anon a querulous note crept into her 
voice—a
                  compromise of sweet and bitter—a woman's sense of 
being wronged struggling with the unreasoning vagaries of a forgiving 
heart.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Esther was not listening. Once or twice
 she fancied she heard<span class="pb"> [PAGE 44] </span>Mrs. MacSmith's
 voice calling her from the next yard. She was tired of sitting on Mrs. 
Mullampy's knee. The shrill cry of
                  her mistress rang out unmistakably now. She felt 
uneasy.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Let me down, please."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Don't go yet, Esther!" the woman 
pleaded, "I want to say something."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">But Esther had reached the door.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Mrs. Mullampy, after all, was little 
more than a girl herself. The romantic story and the coy admissions 
seemed to linger
                  about every ornament in the room when the child had 
gone. A china peacock over the mantel-piece, with tail outspread, 
repeated
                  distinctly, she thought, her own words:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I love him, Esther!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">And the voice of that peacock 
overwhelmed her. She sat aghast. Then slowly, like an apple ripening in 
an hour, her cheeks
                  grew red. She snatched at the tablecloth and buried 
her face in it, like a school-girl trying to hide her blushes.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Esther had not gone. She cautiously 
peeped round the doorway. The horse-shoe was dangling with one end poked
 through a tear
                  in her skirt. She couldn't keep her thoughts off that 
spider. She was tracing with her eyes the different routes it might
                  have taken if she had not intercepted it. Her 
conjectures brought her glance to the corner door. It was ajar, and she 
saw
                  Mr. Mullampy looking at his wife through the opening. 
And she saw Mrs. Mullampy start and cry out when she uncovered her head
                  and found her husband standing beside her.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Jane," he said, softly, "I heard all. 
Forgive me!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The woman was too happy to trust 
herself yet. With the blind instinct of her sex, which always makes a 
show of flying in the
                  face of Fate, however friendly it may be, she 
pretended to be angry at being found out.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Oh," she said pettishly, "it's all 
Esther's fault. She made me say it."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Then God bless Esther!" said the man.</p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 45] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">The girl had run round the back way, 
and was peeping through the window. She saw them kiss. The woman's arms 
were round the
                  man's neck.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then Esther began to cry. She felt that
 she alone was miserable and unhappy.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I've a good mind to throw it," she 
said, raising the horse-shoe threateningly. "Only I can't hit him 
without hitting her."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Anyway, for luck!" she added, throwing
 it over her left shoulder. It fell heavily on a stray fowl belonging to
 Mrs. MacSmith.
                  Esther clapped her hands in glee.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then she took a farewell peep through 
the window, and that which she saw, whatever it was, made her say:</p>

               <p class="normal">"YOU don't believe in 'em?" said Bill. 
"I did n't, either—one time. But if ever you see one—like I did—and you 
lose your girl
                  through it—like I did—you'll believe in 'em right 
enough, I promise you!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Did the girl see it too, Bill?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"My word."</p>

               <p class="normal">"Was I scared! Would you be scared if 
you saw six foot long of ghost coming at you?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Tell us about it, Bill."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Well, mind you, this is a true yarn, 
and you'd better make up your minds there's nothin' funny in it. And 
there's nothin'
                  to laugh at in it, either. So, if any of you fellows 
wants to laugh, he'd better start now, and we'll go outside an' see 
whether
                  he can give me a hidin' or I can give him one. Lend's a
 match." And Bill lit his pipe.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">We promised Bill that we would take his
 yarn seriously, because we could see he would be annoyed if we didn't, 
and Bill scales

               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"They was havin' races at Bogalong," 
said Bill, "at the pub. And there was a little girl working there that I
 was shook on,
                  name of Mary—Mary—darned if I don't forget her other 
name. Now, that's curious, too! Mary—well, no matter. Never mind her
                  other name. But I thought a lot of that girl those 
days. There was a jockey, though, named Joe Chanter, and I always 
thought
                  he was the white-headed boy with Mary, and I had no 
show. But she was only stringing him on, after all. Only Joe never found
                  it out. He was ridin' a colt for the publican this day<span
 class="pb"> [PAGE 47] </span>in the Maiden, and the colt bolted and ran
 into a fence and chucked Joe, and they picked him up with his face 
stove in and
                  his neck broke. He wasn't a bad sort, Joe; a long, 
slim chap he was—tall as me, but thin—some of you chaps might ha' knowed
                  him? No? Lend's a match.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Mary didn't seem much cut-up over the 
accident, though she was keeping the other women company in howlin' most
 of the afternoon.
                  But all the women cheered up a bit after supper, and 
it was decided not to put off the dance at night, because there was a
                  great crowd there, and the publican said it didn't 
matter about Joe—Joe wouldn't mind. Landlord was thinking about what 
he'd
                  lose, you see, if they broke up the party. So they 
cleared the kitchen, and the fiddles played up, and at it they went. 
Now,
                  I never was much of a dancer, and Mary wasn't dancin',
 either; she was helpin' in the bar; so I went in and talked to her
                  instead. By-and-by I got her to come away and sit in 
the best parlour with me.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"There was nobody there, and we sat 
down on the sofa, and got a bit confidential, and she said, when I asked
 her wasn't she
                  shook on Joe, 'No, indeed, not on Joe.' There was 
somebody else—she said. I asked her who was he? She says, 'A lot you 
care!'
                  'Indeed I do care a lot, Mary,' I says. 'I don't 
believe you care anything at all about me,' she says, half crying. 
'Why,'
                  I says, 'Mary, you ought to know' (an' she did know, 
too, only she was foxin') 'that there's nobody in all the world I do
                  care about except you.' Then she began to say 
something, out couldn't get it out for crying, an' I cut in. 'Don't you 
know,
                  Mary, that I love you?' 'I don't know,' says she. 
'Well, I do, then,' I says, 'more than anything else in the whole world.
                  Tell me, do you like me a little? (I got that out of a
 book I'd been readin' she says, half crying. 'Why,' I says, 'Mary,
                  you ought to know' (an' she did know, too, only she 
was foxin') 'that there's nobody in all the world I do care about except
                  you.' Then she began to say something, out couldn't

says, 'more than anything else in the whole world. Tell me, do you like
                  me a little? (I got that out of a book I'd been

 'I don't know,' says she. 'Well, I do, then,' I says, 'more than 
anything
                  else in the whole world. Tell me, do you like me a 
little? (I got that out of a book I'd been readin'. Sounds silly rot, 
doesn't
                  it? Lend's a match.)
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">" 'Yes, I do, Bill,' says she, 'and I 
never liked anyone else.' Well, then, of course you know what a 
fellow'll do when a
                  girl talks that way, and they're by themselves. By the
 Lord, boys, it was a treat to kiss that girl. She was just an armful
                  of loveliness. Funny thing I can't think of her name. 
The music was going it<span class="pb"> [PAGE 48] </span>out at the back
 all the time, and they were dancin' away no end. Presently Mary says 
she'd have to go; she might be wanted;
                  and, of course, I said she'd have to give me another 
kiss before she went. And she was just doin' it, when, all of a sudden,
                  she turns white an' says—
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">" 'Oh, Bill, how wicked we are!'</p>
               
               <p class="normal">" 'Why, Mary,' says I, 'what's wicked 
about this lot?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">" 'Just think, Bill,' she says, 'here 
we are, talkin' love and kissing, an' poor Joe Chanter lyin' dead in the
 very next room!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">" 'Great Scott!' says I; 'is he?' and 
then Mary began to cry and laugh both together like, but she was hardly 
started when
                  I hears an almighty bump on the floor in the next 
room, and then we both looks up, and there was Joe! He was standing at 
the
                  door, wrapped up in his windin'-sheet, and his face 
was covered with blood. Mary gave one yell and ran out by the other 
door,
                  and me after her, like blazes! Scared? Now, wouldn't 
that ha' scared you? Lend's a match."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Well, and what <i>was</i> it, Bill?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Great Scott, ain't I tellin' you! It 
was <i>Joe!</i> Can't a man trust his own flamin' eyesight!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"And what happened after?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"nothin'. Joe was dead enough when the 
rest came in and looked, and they wouldn't believe what I told 'em. Only
 Mary wouldn't
                  look at me next day—seemed frightened like—so I came 
away. I've never been to Bogolong since."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">We all thought Bill's yarn a very 
unsatisfactory one, yet we couldn't get any more out of him. But six 
months afterwards I
                  heard Jim's yarn.

               <p class="normal">II.—JIM'S YARN.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"BOGALONG?" said Jim. "Yes, I've been 
there, and I don't want to go there any more. It was a bit funny, 
though, all the same.
                  Oh, all right, I'll tell you all about it.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I'd just delivered a mob of stores at 
Pilligi, and as I was comin' back, I made Bogalong about dusk. I thought
 I might as<span class="pb"> [PAGE 49] </span>well be a swell for once, 
havin' a bit of stuff, so I reckoned I'd stay at the pub all night. So I
 put my horse up, and had
                  a drink, and asked if I could have a bed. But the 
place was full up—they'd been havin' races that day—and they said there
                  was no bed for me, so I was goin' away. But the 
publican called me back—I s'pose he guessed I had a cheque on me—and 
said
                  he'd find room for me somewhere. 'There's a double 
bed,' says he, 'if you don't mind sharin' it with another man. He's a 
very
                  quiet fellow,' he says; 'I'll answer for him not 
disturbing you.' So I said all right, and after I had a few more drinks I
                  went to bed. They had a dance on, but I wasn't in the 
humour for dancin', for it was a hot night, and I was tired.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"The other fellow must ha' been that 
way, too, I thought, for he was in bed already, I saw, when I went in. I
 didn't take
                  much notice of him, except that he seemed pretty well 
covered up, for such a hot night. But after I put the light out, an'
                  lay down, I found that I'd have to cover up, too, or 
else the mosquitoes would eat me. So I pulled the sheet off the cove
                  an' rolled it round myself, and went to sleep. But the
 noise of the music and the dancin' woke me up after a bit, and I lay
                  awake, growlin' a bit to myself for a time, an' I was 
just goin' off again, when I heard someone talkin' in the next room.
                  I had left the door open, an' could hear quite plain. I
 was goin' to sing out to them to clear out, or shut the door, or 
something,
                  but when I heard what they were sayin', I thought it 
was too good to miss, so I listened.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"It was some fellow doin' a mash with a
 girl, and I couldn't help laughin' to myself to think how mad he'd be 
if he knew somebody
                  was listening. He was pretty solid with the girl, I 
could tell, and by-and-by he started kissin' her, an' I nearly burst 
myself
                  laughin' when that began, and he called her 
sweetheart, and darling, and all that. I was goin' to wake up my mate, 
and let
                  him share the fun, but I thought they might hear me, 
so I lay very quiet, until presently the girl says, 'Oh, Bill! and poor
                  Joe lyin' dead in the very next room!'
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I shoves out my hand as quick as 
lightning, and feels<span class="pb"> [PAGE 50] </span>for my mate's 
face, and—Great Lord! it was as cold as a snake!
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">" 'Holy Wars!' I says, and I gives one 
bound out of bed, forgetting all about the sheet bein' wrapped round my 
legs. I came
                  down an awful buster, and my nose hit the side of the 
bed, and started to bleed like a waterspout But I picked myself up and
                  made for the door, and then I saw the fellow and the 
girl sitting together on the sofa. They had one look at me—I was still
                  rolled up in the sheet, and the blood was running down
 my face—and then they cleared. By Jove they did travel! I got my 
clothes
                  on—I didn't much care about going in for them, 
though—and went out to the stable and got my horse and took the road for
 it,
                  and went on to Blind Creek, and camped there.

               <p class="noindent">INTO the deserted waiting-room, where
 the evening shadows were deepening, a woman came with a slow, uneven 
footstep. She was
                  the last patient but one, and even as she crossed the 
threshold she heard the door of the doctor's consulting-room close 
behind
                  the final case for the day, and knew that already she 
had faded out of the busy man's mind.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She was only one of many, and her case 
was not even an individual one. Daily such conditions as hers came under
 the doctor's
                  notice, and he forgot her before she had passed out 
into the hall.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Her fine grey eyes were dazed; her 
beautiful mouth, made to curve so graciously, drooped with the flabby 
movement by which
                  great misery alters the firmest, sweetest lips.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">In that little room down the passage a 
hard blow had fallen on her, and she sank trembling into a chair and 
held her hands
                  to her eyes. Dream buds, so tenderly, so carefully 
loved and nurtured, had been shrivelled to death in a bitter wind. 
Fair-winged
                  hopes were dashed to the ground, their wings broken, 
and all flying stopped for ever.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She had been told that she never could 
be a mother.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">And at home—that fair home of hers—was 
the husband, who often had dreamed away to her longingly of the little 
bright-faced
                  child with shining hair, and eyes of the purest blue, 
who was to walk beside him some day, and whisper to him tender 
child-things
                  with her hand in his.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"It must be a little girl." How often 
he had said it!</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"A little girl, because she will be 
like you."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">And they even talked about her 
name—this little being whose<span class="pb"> [PAGE 52] </span>coming 
had never been heralded. The mother called her Star-Baby; the father, 
little Annie, for that was the mother's name,
                  and there could be none better.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">And had there been anyone to listen, he
 would have thought their child was already with them, a real, living 
little one. Their
                  lips were always lingering round its name.... "I must 
bring the little one something in my pocket to-night." ... "We must 
never
                  let little Annie pull the cat's whiskers, as these 
children are doing." ... "I should like to buy baby a doll's 
perambulator,
                  like that little girl's."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">And sometimes the mother would go on 
tiptoe to the bedside, and bend down and whisper, "She is fast asleep." 
And the father,
                  not to be outdone in this fond, foolish, primeval 
tenderness, would say, "I think I hear her calling 'Daddy!' "—and he 
would
                  come back presently and say, "The little girl was 
frightened of the dark."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Father! Mother! Never, never could it 
be!</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Her heart sickened at the thought of 
her husband. To her a grief, a sadness that would shadow all her life. 
To him it would
                  be an anguish that would turn all his future into 
Dead-Sea fruit.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He was a man born to be a father. Every
 child loved him and came slowly, hesitatingly as children will, but 
always surely,
                  to his side. He had the indescribable art of making 
conversation with children. He talked to them as if they were as old as
                  he, and that is what wins the little hearts.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">They had been married now two years, 
and for one the world had held no one but themselves—he for her only, 
she for God in
                  him. It was in the second year she learned of his 
longing for a little life he would love to join to theirs.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then all the latent motherhood in her 
sprang to flame, and burnt with a bright, ever-deepening glow that sent a
 warmth over
                  heart and brain, and changed the whole aspect of life.
 Self began to dwindle, dwindle The rush of love flowed over everything
                  that had life—her plants and flowers, and birds and 
dogs;—the mystery of their birth awoke strange thrills in her heart, and
                  their helplessness brought the wonderful bud of 
maternity into fuller, lovelier<span class="pb"> [PAGE 53] </span>bloom.
 Out of love sprang love, and all the waifs and strays of the world were
 touched with this tide of mother tenderness.
                  She could hardly believe it was she, herself, who felt
 so. She had never known that she would care for children. Every woman
                  loves to hold a baby and kiss the helpless hands and 
feet, and that had been all the extent of her love for children until
                  then.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">And now it was all over.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I saw a tiny thing to-day, just like 
little Annie," he was saying.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">They were sitting alone on their 
verandah that looked over a rose-garden towards the sea. Dusk was 
falling, and here and there
                  the light of a coasting steamer gleamed far out on the
 Pacific.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Did you, dear?" she forced herself to 
answer. A week, and she had not told him. A subtle change had come over 
the brightness
                  of her face; in the depths of her eyes lurked 
weariness.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Her father was a working man."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You were glad of that; you were able 
to give her one of your endless pennies."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You're a witch. I own I never see 
these little things without wanting to give them something, and she was 
so tiny, and had
                  just <i>her</i> fair curls."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">For they had often looked, in dreams, 
on the face of their little one; they knew every line and curve, every 
light and shade
                  of the little features.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He came and flung himself at her side, 
and leaned his head against her knee. He reached up for her hand, and 
brought it to
                  rest on his head.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Big Annie," he whispered.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yes," she whispered back to him, and 
tried to keep the pain out of her voice.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Do you know what I was thinking? ... I
 love you—truest, dearest woman—I love you.... You seem to me to be more
 and more beautiful
                  every day.... But sometimes, girl, sometimes we are a 
little lonely.... We are not enough for each other. I look<span 
class="pb"> [PAGE 54] </span>forward and see a time when we might—might 
care for each other a little less, and then a little less. ... But the 
time will
                  never come. ... That is why I want the little one so 
much. Did I hurt you?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"A little. ... You might tire of 
me—might love me less."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Never, never. It is impossible. But it
 must be born in me to love a child, and I am stunted until then. Then I
 shall love
                  you doubly, trebly, a thousand times more dearly."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"But, they say," she murmured—and this 
was the poor little one straw she had been clinging to so desperately 
the whole week
                  past—"they say that a childless man and woman love 
each other more dearly than those who are fathers and mothers. Their 
love
                  retains its early freshness—is a truer comradeship. 
They are all in all to each other, for there is no one to divide their
                  hearts with."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"That may be true of some, not of 
us—not of you, not of me. She will be the great, enduring, eternal bond,
 the only bond that
                  can never weaken."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Like a child himself, he whispered 
against her knee that he longed so for the little arms to be round his 
neck, for the little
                  cheek to be against his; that he yearned to carry her 
about from room to room in his arms, to buy her dollies, and little
                  baby toys. ...
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She thought her heart would break.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">To the old pain, the week-old pain, 
that seemed to have begun whole centuries before, there was now a new 
one added. He could
                  contemplate the time when he might tire of her.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Next, the pain would come when he had 
tired of her.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Tired of her" was an ugly phrase. It 
was not quite what he meant. She knew he was hers in some stronger bond 
than charm or
                  beauty.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">But the atmosphere of his love would 
soon be too still and silent for him; the beauty of it would jar when 
the longing for
                  the little arm was strong on him. Then he would look 
at her critically,<span class="pb"> [PAGE 55] </span>coldly, and wonder 
why her presence there no longer filled the rooms with radiance and a 
sense of rest.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Day by day she lost her brightness, her
 quick capacity for laughter and warm responsiveness. Thought grew 
leaden with turning
                  round and round in the one small place. There were 
cruel moments when her secret bit her like the Spartan's fox, but she 
smiled
                  and forced herself to play her part—the part that some
 day must inevitably be disclosed as hollow.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She forced herself to wander with him 
through all his tender imaginings; she made herself respond to every 
scheme for the
                  little one's happiness.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"When she is old enough we will take 
her to Italy, to Paris. How old ought she to be?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"We will take her when she is eight."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Life altered again. A new revolution, 
and she saw that for herself she could bow to this blow, and some day 
even kiss the
                  hand that dealt it. Her eyes had been opened, and 
selfishness, which is blindness, never could return. The mother-love 
that
                  had been given to her so lavishly need never be wasted
 while the world stretched out around her, hungering everywhere for
                  love.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">But her husband had gathered the little
 one in his arms so often that he almost believed she was there, 
blue-eyed and sunny-haired,
                  with a mouth like a clover for sweetness. To know that
 such a child was never to be born to them would be more bitter than
                  to have Death take her from his arms.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Down she went to the brink of the 
grave, playing the part gaily, tenderly all the while. Wondering with 
him how soon the good
                  God would let them know of little Annie's coming, 
whispering to his whisper that the cling of the little arms was the 
sweetest
                  thing in all the world.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">And only on the grave's brink, with 
Death staring like a hungry wolf into her face, and her heart too torn 
and wounded almost
                  to resist, she told him.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"There never can be any little Annie."</p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 56] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">And she told him she had known it many 
months. Told him that the knowledge, and the thought of the chasm that 
was to divide
                  their lives, had been slowly killing her. Everything 
she laid bare to him,—all her pitiful little mockeries, her tender, sad
                  deceits.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then she was ready to turn away and 
die. But the hungry wolf had seen the agony in the man's face, and fled,
 knowing its time
                  was not yet.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">There, at her side, was the child for 
whom her mother-love might flow, this broken-hearted man, her husband.</p>

 Mother.</h4>
               J. Evison
               
               <p class="noindent">HE was an ancient mariner, and of the
 old school, a fellow-passenger on s.s. <i>Hauroto,</i> Auckland to 
Sydney. We foregathered, refreshed together (he didn't take water in 
his), and subsequently conversed of many
                  things—the way to set a foretopmast stun'sail 
ship-shape and Bristol fashion, religion, the superiority of sail to 
steam,
                  education, blackbirding (he had been there), and, 
lastly, filial affection.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I ain't wot you'd call religious," he 
remarked, "but I believes in a religious eddication. I don't hold with 
this yer new-fangled
                  sekkilar system. I've knocked about promiscuous, an' I
 says early religious trainin' is a first-chop thing. As for what you
                  calls filliul affeckshun, I don't take no stock much 
in fathers—mine brought me up on holystone and rope's-end, dern him!—but
                  no chap's any good onless he's allfired fond of his 
mother. You take it from me."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I acquiesced.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Did you ever come across Bob 
Collop—Captain Collop, that is?" he asked, with seeming irrelevance.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I intimated that I had not the 
voluptuous pleasure of Mr. Collop's acquaintance.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Well, he's a runnin' down to the 
Islands just now, in the Martha and Emily schooner. Years ago me and him
 was sailin' our
                  own schooners on the Chinee coast, Ningpo to Shanghai.
 Lots of Australian chaps was on that lay then. Well, Collop he was
                  an axample of early pious trainin' an' filliul 
affeckshun, an' no bloomin' error. No, there wasn't many as could touch 
Collop!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I hinted that a recital of the manifold
 virtues of Collop<span class="pb"> [PAGE 58] </span>might prove a means
 of grace to myself. And this was the story of Collop—his piety and 
filial affection:—
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">My name's Joful—John Joful. Collop was a
 saint, if ever was one. But you understand me, he was no God-forgot 
teetotaller.
                  There weren't any—not at sea, at least—them days. He'd
 take his tot reg'lar and his religion didn't show out startling, only
                  about once every four months, when he said he'd got a 
letter from his poor old mother in Sydney. I never seed the letters,
                  but I knowed when he had one, for he'd go off on a 
reg'lar religious rampage, so to speak. We would be lyin' in the river
                  and one of his China sailors'd come aboard my craft 
with his teeth a-chatterin' and pig-tail a-stickin' out straight, and
                  say:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Claptin'; you klum makee see Collop; 
he catchee one piecee chopee flom his old muddee; he makee too much 
bobelee, go lah!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then I'd know Collop was took bad with 
piety and filliul thing-ummy. I'd take my boat and six Manila-men and a 
few fathom
                  o' new nine-thread, and pull for Collop's hooker. 
Afore we reached her we'd hear the firing; we'd pull straight down 
ahead,
                  so's he couldn't spot us coming, for he'd be posted on
 the companion-ladder, half up and half down, with a loaded old 
smooth-bore
                  a-restin' on the hatch, and with no dunnage on him 
particular and his hair a-flyin' loose in the breeze, and him six foot
                  four, bare feet, and a fine figger of a man, and 
a-patiently waitin' till something alive showed so's he could shoot at 
it.
                  He misliked heathen drefful, when these pious fits was
 on him—bless you! he'd shoot a Chinaman, or a Malay, or a Manila-man,
                  or a Lascar, or a buck nigger he suspicioned wasn't 
Christianised, whenever he'd heard from his poor old mother. That's how
                  his what-d'ye-call-it affeckshun and early trainin' 
come out. But it showed the nat'ral religion and goodness as was in 
him—didn't
                  it, now?
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I'd fasten my painter to his 
anchor-chain, tell my Manila-men to stand by, shin up and sing out loud,
 "All right, Collop,
                  don't fire! it's only me, Joful!" And I'd dodge 
for'ard of the foremast<span class="pb"> [PAGE 59] </span>till I'd 
drawed his fire; then I'd up stick and get aft, alongside of him, afore 
he could load.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He was always glad to see me, and he'd 
go on loading, so's to be ready for anything as moved. I'd say:</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Had a letter, Collop, old ship?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He'd bust a-cryin' and say:</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yes, Joful—a letter from my poor old 
mo-mother, as taught me piety when I was an innercent nipper at her 
knee."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">And he'd catch sight of some pagan 
heathen a-hidin' behind a water-butt and—<i>bang!</i>'d go his gun, and 
as he'd run the rod through her he'd cry gently to hisself and say:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Missed that yaller thief, Joful. Yes, 
Joful, it was my poor old mother as taught me all the goodness as I 
knows. And I gets
                  a letter from her to-day, a beautiful letter, full of 
hymns and tex's and"—
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then he'd slip, maybe, two bullets in.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"When I was a little, little kid 
a-dressed in my little velvet coat and lace, and my innercent little 
drawers with frills
                  on 'em, she'd fold my hands and teach me"—
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal"><i>Bang!</i> would go his old gun 
again, and he'd say quite sad and solemn:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Another inch to the left, Joful, and 
I'd a hit that fat-headed Chinese <i>lowdah</i> that don't know the 
difference between sou'-east and nor'-west—he don't, as you're a sinner,
 Joful, which you know you are,
                  and a drunkard, which the same is cursed in the Book!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">An' byemby he'd let her rip again.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Oh! Joful, you ain't got religion; you
 can never know what it is to me." And he'd fill her a quarter up with 
powder.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Religion's all I have left; but I'm at
 peace, at peace with all men. Shove up that 300-yard sight for me, 
Joful! There's
                  something in that lorcha's riggin'. 'Pears to me it's 
one of them Goa Portugese. Sinful Roman Catholics they are, them Goa
                  men!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">And after he'd fired that shot, and 
missed—which he did frequent—I'd let a whoop out o' me, and my 
Manila-men'd come swarming
                  over the bows, and we'd run round and round poor<span 
class="pb"> [PAGE 60] </span>Collop with the nine-thread, till we'd 
tangle his legs and throw him, and a awful gay time we'd have, that's a 
fact. We'd
                  bowse him below and lash him to his bunk, and take 
away all his guns an' pistols an' razors an' carving knives, an' I'd sit
                  alongside him and feed him with big spoons of brandy 
or squareface, and talk to him about his good old mother or read chice
                  parts of Scripter—Jonah and the whale, and Paul's 
voyages, and all about the Ark, and Lot and the promises, an' in two or
                  three days these yer religious exercises, and a little
 opium as I give him, 'd pull him round.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">But it showed—didn't it?—the effeck of 
early religious eddication; because, you see, he always fired on them 
occasions with
                  <i>ball,</i> whereas if he'd a-had no proper teachin' 
he 'd 've loaded with <i>shot,</i> and that 'd 've scattered and hit 
something. It was just his mother's lessons.

               <p class="normal">One night in Ningpo, he 'd 'ad one of 
them letters and was flamin'bad. He came nigh killin' the lot of us. The
 third day he
                  says, sudden:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Joful, old blowhard, I'd like to see a
 parson afore I die!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You ain't as bad as that, Bob Collop?"
 I says.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Joful," he answers, "fetch me a 
sky-pilot afore I die."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Well, he was drefful weak and extra 
pious that morning, and I felt as if the angel of thingumybob was 
aboard. I sends a boy
                  down to the mission-station—'Merican Methodees, they 
was—to say as how Captain Collop was a-dyin', an' to send a proper 
certificated
                  sky-pilot—not a mud-hobbler—and, maybe, some physic. 
Towards sundown Collop got worse. Says I to myself: "You're a-goin' out
                  with the tide, a-ebbin' with the ebb, Bob Collop, 
that's what's the matter with you, an' it's spring tides at that."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Byemby a <i>sampan</i> sculls 
alongside, an' in it a missionary cove—a little chap with a white 'elmet
 size of the bunt of a ship's mains'l, and
                  a rumberella set. Says he, very 'aughty and fierce:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Is this the Wanderer, my good man?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You bet," says I.</p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 61] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">"Why isn't there a proper ladder rigged
 for me?" he says like a hadmiral.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Finally we hoisted him on deck, and I 
p'inted to where the dyin' man were; but when I wants to explain—to 
prepare him for
                  Collop and Collop for him—he pushes me aside sayin' we
 men was all the same, a lot of drunken brutes. And down he goes, stiff
                  and grand.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I looked down arter him; there was 
Collop, as I reckoned dyin', standin' in the cabin, smilin' beautiful.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The little chap was very rough with 
poor Collop, orderin' him around like as if he was a Christian converted
 Chinkie, and
                  disremembering as Collop was master mariner, and he 
was only four foot odd, and Collop six foot and inches. an' when Collop
                  begins talkin' about his poor old mother the little 
Methodee says:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I don't want to 'ear that rubbidge. 
Pay me ten dollars, then I'll give you some medicine."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Collop's face turned kinder queer, but 
he planks the dollars, and the missionary he lugs out three powders in 
white paper,
                  and says, a-curlin' his nose:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You'll take one of these now, one at 
eight, and one if you can't sleep."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Says Collop—soft as a sou'-east trade:</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"<i>Which</i> will I take <i>now?</i> 
I'll take 'em for my poor old mother's sake."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You stupid, maudlin fellow, never mind
 your mother! You take one if you can't sleep, one at eight, and one 
now."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Collop he smiled a faded smile and 
asks, poetical: "Mate, <i>which</i> will I take at eight?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"This man's an idiot," says the 
missionary.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"<i>Which</i> will I take if I can't 
sleep?" asks Collop, sweet as East India sugar. "Boss," he goes on, "I'd
 like to own a sky-pilot all
                  to myself. What would a gent of your figger take an' 
sign articles to be my regular chaplain?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"This fellow's drunk <i>and</i> a 
fool," says the other, heavin' his eyes aloft.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 62] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">An' I see his 'and (Collop's 'and) go 
softly, slowly behind him, and afore I could move Collop's arm comes 
round dragging
                  a great rug from off his bunk, and quicker'n you could
 splice the mainbrace he had dumped the gospel-grinder in the centre
                  of that blanket—white 'at, rumberella and all—and then
 he catches hold of the four corners, and ties up the parson inside
                  just as you ties up dirty clothes for the <i>dhobie</i>
 to take to wash. Then he h'ists the bundle on the cabin table, and as 
he sees me a-comin'he just out a revolver as he 'ad
                  'id somehow and says solemn:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No yer don't, Joful, onless you're 
weary, and then I will give you rest. Scripter, don't yer know." I saw 
he meant shoot,
                  and so I waited.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He turns to the bundle of missionary, 
opens the mouth of the blanket an inch or so, and says to what was 
inside:</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Chook! Chook! Chook!" Like as if he'd a
 chicken in there. Then he says, "You're my chaplain!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then he made his chaplain take all them
 three powders, and orders:</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Chaplain, pray for me!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">An' the little chap begins to pray like
 mad, but whether for hisself or Collop I couldn't make out. After a 
time Collop peeps
                  into the parcel again an' orders:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Pray for my poor old mother, 
chaplain!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He prayed.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Sing a hymn, chaplain!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He sang.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Preach me a sermon, chaplain. Lots o' 
'ell-fire in it, please."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He preached.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">But by-an'-by Collop would call him to 
prayers less frequent, and, at last, his head falls back an' he dosses 
off like a tired
                  hinfant. Down I dives, chucks the pistol through the 
port, out knife, an'cuts the little gent adrift, an' such a holy mix
                  you never did see. I gives him a stiff second-mate's 
nip—four fingers up, believe me—an' passes the little creature into his
                  <i>sampan.</i></p>
               
               <p class="normal">Next mornin' Collop wakes up, fresh as 
paint. "A just man<span class="pb"> [PAGE 63] </span>made perfeck am I, 
Joful, you drunken old sinner!"—that's wot he says.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">But it all showed the goodness of his 
heart, an' the good of early pious trainin' an' the inflooence of his 
mother—didn't
                  it now? Because, you know, if Collop hadn't a had them
 yer things, he'd 'ave killed that missionary—what do you say? But not
                  he, not Collop. He just made that little cove pray and
 preach for him like the Levide'n the good Sammarium in the book.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">But there is one thing as puzzles me 
worse nor lograthims; Collop didn't really have them letters from his 
mother; because
                  he didn't have no mother; because he was a Sydney 
foundling—they picked him up, a babby, in a newspaper where Riley-street
                  is now. Old Captain Slumley's wife took him and 
eddicated him with a rolling-pin; an' Slumley—cussing Slumley, they 
called
                  him—didn't have no religion, nor she, except rum. 
Anyway, Collop was true pious, and full of what-d'ye-call-it affeckshun
                  and all that, and an axample to the derned young 
sekkilar larrikins as is box-hauling and buckin' and fillin' about 
Sydney
                  now.

Bush Tanqueray.</h4>
               Albert Dorrington
               
               <p class="noindent">THE coach creaked round a path hewn 
out of the grey sand-stone, leading to the road that ran white and bare 
over the summit
                  of a hill. The driver pulled up. Away down in the 
smoke-laden hollow a number of men gathered and sent up a faint cheer. 
Then
                  a shirt of many colours, supported by yellow moleskin 
trousers, rose solemnly from the box-seat and made some parabolic 
gestures
                  in return. The driver touched his leader tenderly on 
the flank, and the coach wound through lichen-covered boulders into a
                  dingy mulga background. Simultaneously the crowd below
 adjourned to the public-house. A mottle-faced old whaler peeped in
                  at the door to remark, for the fifth time, that "water
 was bad, and the road too stinkin' for anything." No one noticed him
                  until, pressed by a great thirst, he hazarded another 
cast of the die:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Anybody want to 'ear a song—a real 
blanky song without funny business? Ever 'eard 'When Molly marries the 
Ringer'? I'd sing
                  'Billy the Bound'ry,' only I'm gone in the 'igh notes 
through sleepin' in the wet without a bluey."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">A derisive, withering reply sent him 
hobbling to the kerb to examine further the grey ridges that bounded an 
everlasting plain,
                  and the question of his life—the road. Conversation in
 the bar turned upon Benjamin Stokes, the man who had just left by coach
                  for Sydney. Everybody admitted that Ben was too 
reserved and sullen. In the first place, his life had been spent beyond 
the
                  enlightening influence of his fellow-townsmen, in long
 night-watches with stamping herds and vicious colts. "And the result,"
                  said Tackler, the school-master, "is a product as 
rough as Nature, his god. Gentlemen," continued Tackler, seizing a 
gin-and-peppermint,
                  "the man Stokes is a heathen idolater."
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 65] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">And Mottle-face went lamely over the 
hill, his tattered clothes flapping weirdly through a vista of white 
dust.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Ben's trip was to last a month, and 
each week of his absence was duly notched off on the post outside the 
pub. When the notches
                  grew to ten, and he did not return, the circumstance 
was referred to in the <i>Deep Creek Watchman.</i></p>
               
               <p class="normal">Ben had never seen a train before; his 
ideas of city life had been drawn from the rough word-pictures of 
bushmen. The cause
                  of his prolonged absence was explained in the first 
page of his new pocket-book—
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal"><i>Stoping two Teath, one ginny. 
Millysent Lee—cab—Mattrymonal agenc, 3£ 2s. 6d.</i></p>
               
               <p class="normal">One afternoon the coach dropped them at
 the door of a hut near the creek. The driver shook hands with Ben, 
winked at Ben's
                  wife, and flogged his horses over the wooden bridge to
 the township. They stood watching the coach till attention was claimed
                  by a tabby cat which brought out several blind kittens
 for inspection. Her sinful pride led to painful consequences, for a
                  few minutes later the anxious mother mewed piteously 
near the tank, while Benjamin did strange things with her blind 
offspring
                  in a bucket of water.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Millicent threw herself wearily on a 
biscuit-box and slowly took out her hat-pins. The room was stuffy and 
dark; the tiny
                  window and the little tin mirror filled her with 
profound astonishment. In a corner was a narrow bed that met the 
requirements
                  of a long single man, and its presence plainly 
indicated that the whole wedlock business was unpremeditated. A sporting
 print
                  on the wall depicted "Jimmy the Biff" going sweet and 
fresh after ten hard rounds with "Mick the Nipper" from Bendigo.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Through a large hole in the wall near 
the fire-place Ben apologised for the speckled condition of the nuptial 
chamber—due,
                  he explained, to the goats and fowls. By-and-by he 
might nail up the hole with a bag; it was getting too big. Some night an
                  enterprising cow would squeeze through and breathe 
over a married<span class="pb"> [PAGE 66] </span>couple—he'd nail it up 
now. He rushed away, and there were sounds of a man chopping wood.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The next day was Sunday. Ben took out a
 concertina from the hollow log where it had lain for weeks; and, 
tucking it under
                  his arm, stole down to the creek bend, where the belt 
of coolabahs would hide his musical proceedings from Mill. He began
                  to wonder if she were really found of music. Anyhow, 
he would practise a bit before submitting anything to her judgment. She
                  had lived all her life in swell boarding-houses where 
the aristocracy sat down to the piano and gave it what for. He reckoned
                  that Mill would be very hard to please; still, a 
concertina was as good as a piano, and if he could only get hold of a 
few
                  rattling tunes he'd spring 'em on her suddenly—he'd go
 marching up the track swinging his instrument over his head and filling
                  the bush with an imitation of cathedral bells. His 
mother used to say he had a grand forehead for music. He looked back 
over
                  his shoulder to see if Mill were watching him from the
 door. A screw of smoke trailed from the tiny chimney, winding like
                  a scarf across the roof of the bush.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">How different the country seemed since 
he had returned! The blazed eucalypt that had always reminded him of a 
crucified man
                  looked quite cheerful; the cattle were in better 
condition; the very atmosphere held some hidden witchery that set him 
aglow
                  as if he had drunk wine from the billy instead of tea.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He sat on a boulder hugging his 
concertina. The coming of this grey-eyed town-girl would change his 
life. There had been times
                  when he used to sit alone clasping his knees and 
smoking until he felt sick and giddy. People said he was sulkier than a 
calf.
                  Yet there were hundreds of lads who lived as he had 
lived, with the unresponsive bush for a mistress and slavering, red-eyed
                  cattle for comrades.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The first few notes from his concertina
 seemed to wake the morning stillness; a couple of inquisitive magpies 
chortled back
                  melodiously as if defying the big sun-tanned stripling
 to out-clamour them.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 67] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">He rose suddenly and pitched a stone in
 their direction. "Go way, yer bloomin' cadgers! yous sneak about when 
yous ain't wanted.
                  Gerrout!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"<i>Ha, ha, ha! ho, ho, ho!</i>"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">A kingfisher sailed over the hut roof 
and settled on the lower branch of a gun.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"<i>Ho, ho, ho!</i>"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The savage, insulting laughter cracked 
discordantly along the hollow.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">For a moment the hot blood swam in 
Ben's cheeks; the same bird had shed laughter a thousand times over his 
hut, but never
                  till now had he felt how closely the cackle resembled 
the fierce mockery from a human throat.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">When he returned Mill was clearing out 
the garnered litter of his bachelor days—leaky, rust-eaten billies, old 
boots and bridle
                  straps, fearsome pictures of groggy pugilists and bush
 racehorses. He whistled softly, with his body half in the doorway,
                  wondering whether he had better take off his hat 
before entering.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">After breakfast Millicent hinted weakly
 about going to church. "Right, Mill!" said Ben, dropping the saw he was
 greasing;
                  "we'll go now, though I've never been before. Put on 
your grey dress and the hat with the big black feather."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He followed her inside.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">When they started, Ben walked ahead 
swinging his arms so that the shortness of his sleeves might not attract
 Mill's attention.
                  For the first time in his life he took an interest in 
the long shadow that stretched about six fathoms ahead. In the middle
                  of it was a hideous kink where the saddle had pressed 
his coat-tail outwards. The ridiculous shape of it hurt Ben beyond 
words.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Mill panted after him—he was sublimely 
unconscious that his terrific pace distressed her. She caught his hand: 
he slackened
                  instantly and blushed a peony red.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The track swung over a hillock where 
the scattered cairns<span class="pb"> [PAGE 68] </span>of pick-torn 
stone recalled a one-time mining camp. They rested awhile: Ben propped 
himself against a blue-gum.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yer git a good breeze here on hot 
nights, Mill. Grand place fer a breeze."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">She did not answer; her fingers were 
shut over his, her parted lips drank the mountain air.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The rocks filtered great drops of 
mouth-cooling water into their outstretched hands: the sun stalked 
valiantly across the
                  naked East, over treeless gullies and rolling downs. 
Through the still scrub they caught the moving gleams of tawny light
                  radiated from leaf to leaf into the deeps of ebon 
shadows. He touched her hand unconsciously, and the wanton blood leaped
                  to her throat and temples. She looked at him, and he 
seemed to her a part of the big, secret Bush. The light of morning was
                  in his eyes, a fierce young light that she had not 
seen in the eyes of men who lurked under gasaliers and crouched over 
desks.
                  He was staring absently at the red cattle wallowing in
 the reed-choked lagoon. He turned suddenly; his long arm went out 
towards
                  the tin-roofed box in the hollow.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"It ain't a flash place I've brought 
yer to, Mill. Yer might ha' done better."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Mill tugged at her cheap gloves and 
laughed softly. "Yer right, Ben, it ain't flash; but, Lord! we'll pull 
through."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Course we will." He glanced at her 
stealthily, and noted the handful of shop violets tucked cunningly under
 the brim of her
                  straw hat. There was n't a woman in the township who 
could fix violets over her little ear in the same way. He moistened his
                  lips.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"We oughter be happy here, Mill," he 
said, "seein' it's me an' you."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yes, Ben," she acquiesced.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"They're alright people in Pyers when 
you know 'em," went on Ben; "an' they're bound to take to you—bein' 
friendly with me,
                  yer see."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She rose and took his arm. "O' course, 
Ben."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He stretched himself on his disengaged 
side and breathed lustily. The world seemed so young and glorious—it 
made his eyes<span class="pb"> [PAGE 69] </span>water. His voice 
trembled a little as he said, "Yer wouldn't believe what a place this is
 fer a breeze."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">They moved onwards.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He chose a seat directly under the 
pulpit. "Keep yer 'ead agin the mahogany, Mill; they'll be dyin' to see 
yer face when they
                  come in; don't let 'em!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The church at this time was empty; but 
it filled—filled to overflowing. "Don't forgit the mahogany, Mill!" 
whispered Ben behind
                  his hand.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Their pew remained as sacred as a Hindu
 cow. The coach-driver pointed them out from a crowded porch, and his 
audience appeared
                  spasmodically grateful for the information concerning 
Mrs. Ben. The driver admitted regretfully that his friend, Sam Hopkins,
                  knew her pretty well, thanks—"wished I knew her as 
well." Still, it was n't for him to take away the character of a 
respectable
                  married woman. Heard that she could cook as good a 
feed as anybody in Pyers, and if—— The organ took it up, and sent out a
                  moaning "Adeste Fideles."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The minister thundered at his stoic 
congregation, and charged the air with strange, charitable precepts. At 
the end he waved
                  a calm benediction over his respectable flock: "Go in 
peace, and sin no more!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The men leered at Ben and Mill as they 
passed out; young girls gathered up skirts and scattered; obese wives 
and mothers cannoned
                  in circling, agitated groups.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Thank God the roof did n't fall on us 
this blessed day! The idea!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Ben lifted his head and eyed the 
hostile gathering; some of them had known him for years—since the time 
when he used to drive
                  about Pyers in a billy-goat tandem. A shout of mocking
 laughter followed them to the gate. Ben clinched his mouth; an unknown
                  shame spread to his neck and face: something gripped 
his arm, and a word hummed in his ear that an ordinary woman never uses
                  at any period of her life.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 70] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">So they tramped along, voiceless and 
sullen, through paddocks where flowers nodded to a caressing wind, while
 the sun drew
                  perfumes from the moist Spring earth. Mill's right 
hand bruised her breast savagely; the other held his sleeve.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She glanced furtively at him across the
 room—his head down, his chin resting in the heel of his palm.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Did I ever say I was a good girl, Ben?
 I ain't, Gawd 'elp me!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">She thrust herself beside him, shaking 
and trembling. Then Benjamin Stokes listened, almost for the first time 
in his life,
                  to the commonest story in the world—a betrayal, a 
little shame, a gradual hardening, a world-defiance.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"The old woman at the boardin'-house 
said she'd clear me out unless I was obligin' and civil to the 
gentlemen. So there were
                  presents for Mill, and gloves planted in my bed ... It
 all helped to take my head away from the damned 'ard scrubbin'. I ain't
                  old—nineteen ain't very old, is it? Gimme a chance, 
Ben—gimme a chance!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Something simmered in the fireplace; 
plates clattered; a shadowy girl moved about him all the afternoon in a 
dull, half-frightened
                  way. He stumbled outside to the wood-heap, and the 
soft-eyed collie hung at his heels for a word.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The sun dropped to the edge of the 
plains, drenching the far-off hills with yellow mist. A rush of cool air
 brought the clang
                  of bells; he raised a rough and haggard face and spoke
 a word to the night—a word he used when punching cattle through an
                  overflow. The dog fawned joyously ... "Away, you 
beast!"—and a savage kick sent it howling down the track.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">A candle flickered in the little 
bedroom, throwing a shape across the chintz curtain. "That bell again!" 
He walked a short
                  distance from the house. How everyone knew! How 
everyone guessed the truth! What had happened at the church to-day would
 happen
                  again with sickening regularity. He might force the<span
 class="pb"> [PAGE 71] </span>men to respect him with his fists; but 
that cackling brood in the porch!
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He struck a match and groped into the 
room to fling a word of hate at this Magdalen—and fell into a chair, 
silenced. The face
                  was so pretty, so weak—prey for every libertine. The 
minister had said something about a woman who wiped the feet of Christ
                  with her long meshes of hair; nobody believed it, of 
course; if they did, why was Mill treated as she had been? He sat 
through
                  the long night, heavy-browed and brooding, until a 
grey light from the east whitened the window-pane.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Mill!" She smiled sleepily at the 
word.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Mill!" The sound of his voice made her
 crouch on the rough pallet; she stared at the white, haggard face in 
the half-light.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Don't be frightened, Mill!—don't be 
frightened; I shan't hit yer. I've been thinkin'; and we ain't goin' to 
church again
                  to let 'em worry us. I'll build another place over at 
Red Point on the hundred-acre patch; if they come there to carry on
                  I'll be about to receive 'em."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Her face was hidden from him, but her 
hand crept into his big palm.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">A few hours later Ben led a bay horse 
to the front and hopped into the saddle. She came to the door, her white
 arms splashed
                  with milk and flour.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"It's a long way to the Point, ain't 
it, Ben?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yeh!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">She stole nearer—obviously to examine 
the horse. He threw himself forward and kissed her on the lips.</p>

 Hurricane.</h4>
               F. Marryat Norris
               
               <p class="noindent">ASTONISHMENT is a word which faintly 
expresses the feeling of the ship's company when we learnt that Captain 
Basher had married.
                  And when we saw the lady the puzzle grew harder than 
ever. She had been a Mrs. M'Cluskie—and looked it. Tall, bony, red, and
                  freckled, with eyes the colour of galvanised iron, and
 teeth which would not have disgraced a small elephant—she was the 
finest
                  sample of the unadulterated female porridge-eater that
 ever I clapped eyes on. She was to sail with us, too. We trembled.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">It turned out that the captain had 
married her for the sake of the late M'Cluskie's money, and during the 
first half of that
                  voyage he earned every penny of it. The ex-widow ruled
 the ship from the first moment she put her prunella-shod foot aboard
                  us. Basher, the rollicking dare-devil, was tamed to 
the demeanour of a mouse. His wife was as pious as she was prudish, and
                  she was as prudish as a prayer-meeting full of old 
maids. Basher shivered in his complaisance. He cuffed an ordinary seaman
                  for unwittingly applying its proper name to a certain 
portion of the topsail brace-block. The coppered part of the vessel
                  was always alluded to in the lady's presence as "the 
underneath part"; and the belly of a sail was spoken of apologetically,
                  with bated breath. On Mrs. B.'s washing days, it was 
sacrilege to look over the counter, for the more essentially feminine
                  of her garments were hung to dry from a sort of 
"parsheeboom," rigged from the stern ports, and secure from the 
irreverent
                  gaze of the rude sailor-man.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Basher lived two lives. With Mrs. B. 
below, he was his own profane self; with Mrs. B. on deck, it was "Mr. 
Brown, kindly step for'ard, and ascertain if the fore-to'-gallant-mast 
is sufficiently<span class="pb"> [PAGE 73] </span>stayed,"—or "Bo's'n, 
please inform the hands that to-morrow, being the Sabbath, Divine 
service will be held in the saloon,
                  <i>as usual</i>"—ye gods! The strain on Basher must 
have been awful.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">We were somewhere about the 50th 
parallel of latitude, having had to go farther to the southward than 
usual to look for wind,
                  when Captain Basher rose in revolt. "This is too d——d 
fine a passage, Mr. Brown," he explained confidentially as he arranged
                  his plan of campaign; "an' I guess, if we don't assist
 the blanky course of Nature, I'll never live to see port. So—to-morrow
                  night!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The next night came, starlit and 
beautiful. The weather being decidedly cold, Mrs. Basher had retired 
early to her bunk. There
                  was a big swell; and the vessel was brought beam-on to
 it. The dead-lights, previously loosened by the carpenter, were removed
                  from the deck above the cabin in which the lady 
slumbered, and a length of hose was led to reach from the "Downton" 
pump,
                  at which four vigorous seamen waited eagerly for the 
order to "shake her up." A couple of hands were stationed on the 
half-round,
                  with draw-buckets.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The ship was rolling terribly, scooping
 it up over both rails, and threatening to sling the sticks out of her. 
Captain Basher
                  arrived on deck in a hurry, having locked his 
lady-love in her berth.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Now, then, my lads, let her have it!" 
he said, and we did. That pump was never worked as it was worked that 
night, and the
                  water poured in at the deck, whilst the men with the 
draw-buckets kept up a terrific broadside of cold salt-water through
                  the open ports. The rest of the watch were employed 
with handspikes in thundering on the deck above Mrs. B.'s head. Basher
                  at intervals bellowed orders of a heroic nature, 
whilst an apprentice and I kept the little brass signal-gun going till 
she
                  got too hot to use.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Every few minutes our gallant captain 
would rush below to the door of the cabin. "Be brave, Jessie, my love, 
and remain where
                  you are! We may yet weather this awful storm,"—he 
would roar through the keyhole; or, "Do not abandon hope, my dear 
beloved
                  wife! the hurricane is now on our weather bow; but 
trust in God<span class="pb"> [PAGE 74] </span>and your William, and 
remember everything depends on your keeping cool." (Poor Mrs. B. was in 
all conscience cool enough.)
                  Then, deaf to her screams to be liberated, Basher 
would rush on deck again to exhort us to further exertion.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">We kept it up for two hours, when the 
captain gave orders to "ease up handsomely," and on things being made 
shipshape, the
                  vessel was brought to her course again. Basher, having
 donned his oilskin and a life-belt, was pumped on to clinch the 
realism,
                  and went below to his affrighted spouse, who was by 
this time more dead than alive.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">We made the Cape ten days afterwards, 
and Mrs. B. did not continue the voyage with us, preferring to take 
steam to Plymouth.
                  That was ten years ago, and the lady has never 
forgotten the horrors of that awful night. Captain Basher is living on 
her
                  money somewhere Deptford way, secure from hurricanes 
and similar perils, for his wife will not hear of him going to sea 
again,
                  with or without her.

miles to the nearest sign of civilisation—a shanty on the main road.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The drover—an ex-squatter—is away with 
sheep. His wife and children are left here alone.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The children are playing about the 
house—four of them, ragged and dried-up looking. Suddenly one yells: 
"Snake! Mother, here's
                  a snake!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The gaunt, sun-browned bushwoman darts 
from the kitchen, snatches "the baby" from the ground, holds it on her 
left hip, and
                  reaches for a stick.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Where is it?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Here! gone into the wood-heap!" yells 
the eldest boy—a sharp-faced, excited urchin of eleven. "Stop there, 
mother! I'll have
                  him. Stand back! I'll have the beggar!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Tommy, come here, or you'll be bit. 
Come here at once when I tell you, you little wretch!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The youngster comes reluctantly, 
carrying a stick bigger than himself. Suddenly he yells, triumphantly:</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"There it goes—under the house!" and 
darts away with club uplifted. At the same time, the big, black, 
yellow-eyed dog-of-all-breeds,<span class="pb"> [PAGE 76] </span>who has
 shown the greatest interest in the proceedings, breaks his chain and 
darts after that snake. He is a moment late,
                  however, and his nose reaches the crack in the slabs 
just as the end of the snake's tail disappears. Almost at the same 
moment
                  the boy's club comes down and skins the aforesaid 
nose. The dog takes small notice of this, and proceeds to undermine the
                  building; but he is subdued after a struggle, and 
chained up. They can't afford to lose him.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The drover's wife makes the children 
stand together near the dog-house while she watches for the snake. She 
gets two small
                  dishes of milk, and sets them down near the wall to 
tempt the snake out; but an hour goes by, and it does not show itself.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">It is near sunset, and a thunderstorm 
is coming. The children must be brought inside. She will not take them 
into the house,
                  for she knows the snake is there, and may at any 
moment come up through a crack in the rough slab floor. So she carries 
several
                  armfuls of firewood into the kitchen, and then takes 
the children there. The kitchen has no floor, or rather an earthen one,
                  called a "ground floor" in this part of the bush. 
There is a large, roughly-made table in the centre. She brings the 
children
                  in and makes them get on this table. They are two boys
 and two girls—mere babies. She gives them some supper, and then, before
                  it gets dark, she goes into the house, and snatches up
 some pillows and bed-clothes—expecting to see or lay her hand on the
                  snake any moment. She makes a bed on the kitchen table
 for the children, and sits down beside it to watch all night.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She has an eye on the corner, and a 
green sapling club laid in readiness on the dresser by her side; also, 
her sewing-basket
                  and a copy of the <i>Young Ladies' Journal.</i> She 
has brought the dog into the room.

               <p class="normal">Tommy turns in under protest, and says 
he'll lie awake all night and smash that blinded snake.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">His mother asks him how many times she

               <p class="normal">He has his club with him under the 
bed-clothes, and the child next to him protests:</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Mummy! Tommy's skinnin' me alive wiv 
his club! Make him take it out!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Tommy: "Shet up, you little——! D'yer 
want to be bit with the snake?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Jacky shuts up.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"If yer bit," says Tommy, after a 
pause, "you'll swell up, an' smell, an' turn red an' green an' blue all 
over till yer bust.
                  Won't he, mother?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Now then, don't frighten the child. Go
 to sleep," she says.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The two younger children go to sleep, 
and now and then Jacky complains of being "skeezed." More room is made 
for him. Presently
                  Tommy says: "Mother! listen to them (adjective) little
 'possums. I'd like to screw their blanky necks."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">And Jacky protests drowsily:</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"But they don't hurt us, the little 
blanks!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Mother: "There, I told you you'd teach 
Jacky to swear." But Jacky's remark makes her smile. Jacky goes to 
sleep.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Presently, Tommy asks:</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Mother! Do you think they'll ever 
'sterminate the (adjective) kangaroos?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Lord! How am I to know, child? Go to 
sleep."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Will you wake me if the snake comes 
out?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yes. Go to sleep."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Near midnight. The children are asleep 
and she sits there still, sewing and reading by turns. From time to time
 she glances
                  round the floor and wall-plate, and whenever she hears
 a noise she reaches for the stick. The thunderstorm comes on, and the
                  wind, rushing through the cracks in the slab wall, 
threatens to blow out her candle. She places it on a sheltered place of
                  the dresser, and fixes up a newspaper to protect it. 
At every flash of lightning, the cracks between the slabs gleam like
                  polished silver. The thunder rolls, and the rain comes
 down in torrents.

               <p class="normal">Alligator (the dog) lies at full length
 on the floor, with his eyes turned towards the partition. She knows by 
this that the
                  snake is there. There are huge cracks in that wall, 
opening under the floor of the dwelling-house.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She is not a coward, but recent events 
have shaken her nerves. A little son of her brother-in-law was lately 
bitten by a snake,
                  and died. Besides, she has not heard from her husband 
for six months, and is anxious about him.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He was a drover, and started squatting 
here when they were married. The drought of 18—ruined him. He had to 
sacrifice the
                  remnant of his flock and go droving again. He intends 
to move his family into the nearest town when he comes back, and, in
                  the meantime, his brother, who lives on the main road,
 comes over about once a month with provisions. The wife has still a
                  couple of cows, one horse, and a few sheep. The 
brother-in-law kills one of the latter occasionally, gives her what she 
needs
                  of it, and takes the rest in return for other 
provisions.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She is used to being left alone. She 
once lived like this for eighteen months. As a girl, she built the usual
 air-castles,
                  but all her girlish hopes and aspirations are dead. 
She finds all the excitement and recreation she needs in the <i>Young 
Ladies' Journal,</i> and—Heaven help her!—takes a pleasure in the 
fashion-plates.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Her husband is an Australian, and so is
 she. He is careless, but a good enough husband. If he had the means, he
 would take
                  her to the city and keep her there like a princess. 
They are used to being apart, or at least she is. "No use frettin'," she
                  says. He may forget sometimes that he is married; but 
if he has a good cheque when he comes back, he will give most of it
                  to her. When he had money, he took her to the city 
several times—hired a railway sleeping-compartment, and put up at the 
best
                  hotels. He also bought her a buggy; but they had to 
sacrifice that along with the rest.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The last two children were born in the 
bush—one while her husband was bringing a drunken doctor, by force, to 
attend to her.
                  She was alone on this occasion, and very weak. She had
 been ill<span class="pb"> [PAGE 79] </span>with a fever. She prayed to 
God to send her assistance. God sent Black Mary—the "whitest" gin in all
 the land.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">One of her children died while she was 
here alone. She rode nineteen miles for assistance, carrying the dead 
child.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">It must be near one or two o'clock. The
 fire is burning low. Alligator lies with his head resting on his paws, 
and watches
                  the wall. He is not a very beautiful dog to look at, 
and the light shows numerous old wounds where the hair will not grow.
                  He is afraid of nothing on the face of the earth, or 
under it. He will tackle a bullock as readily as he will tackle a flea.
                  He hates all other dogs—except kangaroo dogs—and has a
 marked dislike to friends or relations of the family. They seldom call,
                  however. He sometimes makes friends with strangers. He
 hates snakes, and has killed many, but he will be bitten some day,
                  and die; most snake-dogs end that way.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Now and then the bushwoman puts down 
her work, and watches, and listens, and thinks. She thinks of things in 
her own life,
                  for there is little else to think about.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The rain will make the grass grow, and 
this reminds her how she fought a bush-fire once, while her husband was 
away. The grass
                  was long, and very dry, and the fire threatened to 
burn her out. She put on an old pair of her husband's trousers, and beat
                  out the flames with a green bough till great drops of 
sooty perspiration stood out on her forehead and ran in streaks down
                  her blackened arms. The sight of his mother in 
trousers greatly amused Tommy, who worked like a little hero by her 
side; but
                  the baby howled lustily to be taken up, and the fire 
would have mastered her but for four excited bushmen, who arrived in
                  the nick of time. It was a mixed-up affair all round. 
When she went to take up the baby he screamed and struggled 
convulsively,
                  thinking it was a "black man"; and Alligator, trusting
 more to the child's sense than his own instinct, charged furiously,
                  and (being old and slightly deaf) did not in his 
excitement at first recognise his mistress's voice, but continued to 
hang
                  on to the moleskins until choked off by Tommy<span 
class="pb"> [PAGE 80] </span>with a saddle-strap. The dog's sorrow for 
the mistake, and his anxiety to let it be known that it was all a 
mistake, were
                  as evident as his ragged tail and a six-inch grin 
could make them. It was a glorious time for the boys; a day to look back
                  to, and talk about, and laugh over for many years.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She thinks how she fought a flood 
during her husband's absence. She stood for hours in the drenching 
downpour, and dug a drain
                  to save the dam across the creek. But she could not 
save it. There are things that a bushwoman cannot do. Next morning the
                  dam was broken, and her heart was nearly broken too, 
for she thought how her husband would feel when he came home and saw
                  the result of months of labour swept away. She "cried"
 then.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She also fought "the pleuro," dosed and
 bled the few remaining cattle, and wept again when her two best cows 
died.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Again, she fought a mad bullock that 
besieged the house for a day. She made bullets and fired at him through 
cracks in the
                  slabs, with an old shot-gun. He was dead in the 
morning. She skinned him, and afterwards got seven-and-six pence for the
 hide.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She also fights the crows and eagles 
that have designs on her chickens. Her plan of campaign is very 
original. The children
                  cry "Crows, mother!" and she rushes out and aims a 
broom-stick at the birds, as though it were a gun, and says "<i>Bung!</i>"
 The crows leave in a hurry; they are cunning, but a woman's cunning is 
greater.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Occasionally a bushman in the horrors, 
or a villainous-looking sundowner, comes and scares the life out of her.
 She generally
                  tells the suspicious-looking stranger that "My husband
 and two sons are at work below the dam," for he always cunningly 
enquires
                  for "the boss."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Only last week a gallows-faced 
swagman—having satisfied himself or been informed that there were no men
 on the place—threw
                  his swag down on the verandah, and demanded "tucker." 
She gave him something to eat, and he expressed his intention of staying
                  for the night It was sundown then. She got a batten 
from the sofa, loosened the dog, and confronted the stranger—holding the<span
 class="pb"> [PAGE 81] </span>batten in one hand and the dog's collar 
with the other. "Now, you go!" she said. He looked at her and at the 
dog, and said,
                  "All right, mum," in a cringing tone, and left. She 
was a determined-looking woman, and Alligator's yellow eyes glared 
unpleasantly.
                  Besides, the dog's chawing-up apparatus seemed not 
unlike a real alligator's.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She has few pleasures to think of as 
she sits here alone by the fire, on guard against a snake. All days are 
much the same
                  to her; but on Sunday afternoons she dresses herself, 
tidies the children, smartens up baby, and goes for a lonely walk along
                  the bush-track, pushing an old perambulator in front 
of her. She does this every Sunday. She takes as much care to make 
herself
                  and her children "look smart," as she would if she 
were going to "do the block" in Sydney. There is nothing to see, 
however,
                  and not a soul to meet. You may walk for twenty miles 
along this track without being able to fix a point in your mind, unless
                  you are a bushman. This is because of the maddening, 
everlasting sameness of the stunted trees —that monotony which makes
                  a new-chum long to break away and travel as far as 
trains can go, and sail as far as ships can sail, and farther.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">But this bushwoman is used to the 
loneliness of it. As a girl-wife she hated it, but now she would feel 
strange away from
                  it.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She is glad when her husband returns, 
but she does not gush or make a fuss about it. She gets him something 
good to eat, and
                  tidies up the children.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She seems contented with her lot. She 
loves her children, but has no time to show it. She seems harsh to them.
 Her surroundings
                  are not favourable to the development of the "womanly"
 or sentimental side of her nature.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">It must be near morning now, but the 
clock is in the other room. Her candle is nearly done; she forgot that 
she was out of
                  candles. Some more wood must be got to keep the fire 
up, so she shuts the dog inside and hurries round to the wood-heap.<span
 class="pb"> [PAGE 82] </span>The rain has cleared off. She seizes a 
stick, pulls it out, and—<i>crash!</i> the whole pile collapses, and 
nearly frightens her to death.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Yesterday she bargained with a stray 
blackfellow to bring her some wood, and while he was at work she went in
 search of a
                  missing cow. She was absent an hour or so, and the 
black made good use of his time. On her return she was astonished to see
                  a great heap of wood by the chimney. She gave the 
black an extra fig of tobacco, and praised him for not being lazy. He 
thanked
                  her, and left with head erect. But he had built the 
wood-heap hollow.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She is hurt now, and tears spring to 
her eyes as she sits down again by the table. She snatches up a 
handkerchief to wipe
                  the tears away, but pokes her eyes with her bare 
fingers instead. The handkerchief is full of holes, and she finds that 
she
                  has put her thumb through one and her forefinger 
through another.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">This makes her laugh suddenly, to the 
surprise of the dog. She has a keen, very keen sense of the ridiculous; 
and, some time
                  or another, she will amuse bushmen by relating this 
incident. Often she has told how one day she sat down "to have a good
                  cry," as she said—and the old cat rubbed against her 
dress and "cried too." Then she "had to laugh."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Now it is near daylight. The room is 
very close and hot because of the fire. Alligator still watches the wall
 from time to
                  time. Suddenly he becomes greatly interested; he draws
 himself a few inches nearer the partition, and a thrill runs through
                  his body. The hair on the back of his neck begins to 
bristle, and the battlelight is in his yellow eyes. She knows what this
                  means, and lays her hand on the stick. The lower end 
of one of the partition slabs has a large crack on each side of it. An
                  evil pair of small, bright, bead-like eyes glistens at
 one of these holes The snake—a black one—comes slowly out, about a
                  foot, and moves its head up and down The dog lies 
still, and the woman sits as one fascinated. The snake comes out a foot
                  further. She lifts her stick, and the reptile, as 
though suddenly aware of danger, sticks his head in through the crack on
                  the other side of the slab, and hurries to get<span 
class="pb"> [PAGE 83] </span>his tail round after him. Alligator 
springs, and his jaws come together with a snap. He misses this time, 
for his nose is
                  large, and the snake's body is close down in the angle
 formed by the slab and the floor. He snaps again as the tail comes
                  round. He has the snake now, and tugs it out eighteen 
inches. <i>Thud! thud!</i> comes the woman's club on the ground. 
Alligator pulls again. <i>Thud! thud!</i> Alligator pulls some more. He 
has the snake out now—a black brute, five feet long. The head rises to 
dart about, but the
                  dog has the enemy close to the neck. He is a big, 
heavy dog, but as quick as a terrier. He shakes the snake as though he 
felt
                  the original curse in common with mankind. The eldest 
boy wakes up, seizes his stick, and makes to get out of bed, but his
                  mother forces him back with a grip of iron. <i>Thud! 
thud!</i> the snake's back is broken in several places. <i>Thud! thud!</i>
 the head is crushed, and Alligator's nose skinned again.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The woman lifts the mangled reptile on 
the point of her stick, carries it to the fire and throws it in. Then 
she piles on
                  the wood, and watches the snake burn. The boy and dog 
watch, too. She lays her hand on the dog's head, and all the fierce,
                  angry light dies out of his yellow eyes. The younger 
children are quieted, and presently go to sleep. The dirty-legged boy
                  stands for a moment in his shirt, watching the fire. 
Presently he looks at her. He sees the tears in her eyes, and, suddenly
                  throwing his arms round her neck, exclaims:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Mother, I won't never go drovin'; 
blast me if I do!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">And she hugs him to her worn-out breast
 and kisses him, and they sit thus together while the sickly daylight 
breaks over the
                  bush.

Night at Kelly's.</h4>
               Perce Abbott
               
               <p class="noindent">IT looked like rain as I got off the 
coach. Leaving my bags and rug on the road, I climbed the hillside, on 
which Pat Kelly's
                  pub. was fastened in some mysterious way that kept it 
from being blown over by the tornadoes which rushed up and down the
                  narrow cleft between the hills.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Arrived on the verandah, I said to the 
landlord, "Those are my bags at the foot of the hill." The information 
did not seem
                  to interest him much, as he made no reply, but went 
into the bar and began rubbing a dirty glass with a dirty towel, as if
                  expecting an order; also, he wiped his sore eyes with 
that towel. No business eventuating, he called a servant to show me
                  a room.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">While waiting, I noticed that the 
passage was sprinkled with straw and stable litter, which the wind had 
blown in at the back
                  door and had not strength to blow out at the front, so
 the refuse lay there waiting for the next squall. A crowd of dirty,
                  bare-legged children ran about, crying and fighting, 
and, as I stood in the passage, a lady with a fat, bloated face and 
swollen
                  eyelids came to a bedroom-door and looked at me with 
that serious intentness assumed by most drunken people when trying to
                  appear perfectly sober. I was not sure whether she was
 my hostess until she clouted one or two of the howling children in
                  an absent sort of way, as if it were a matter of 
habit. After this she shut the door with a lofty look that seemed to say
                  she thought it would be unladylike to speak to me 
without an introduction.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The servant now appeared, a fat girl, 
with uncombed hair and bare feet. Her dress was open for two or three 
hooks at the neck,
                  and, as if that did not display her charms 
sufficiently, there was a spacious rent above the collar-bone. She<span 
class="pb"> [PAGE 85] </span>showed me to my room with many smirks and 
coquettish looks, and —though her dress reached only to her ankles, and 
had a placket-gap
                  three inches across—grabbed a handful of it at the 
back and lifted it up, after the fashion of a lady crossing a muddy 
street.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">By this time it was raining heavily, 
and I congratulated myself on being housed for the night. After 
half-an-hour I thought
                  of something I wanted in my bags, but, on going to the
 room, they were nowhere to be found. I then went to the bar and asked
                  Kelly. He looked astonished:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Bags, is it? Shure I dunno; barrin' 
they're wher' ye lift thim."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"But why were they not brought in?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Ye niver said annythin' about wantin' 
thim in."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"But I told you where they were."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yis, ye did; but I t'ought ye only 
mintioned it t' make the conversation interestin' loike. But hould an; 
I'll call Mike....
                  Mick! Mickee!!" he shouted; but there was no response.
 "Ah, niver moint; I'll sind him for thim bine-boi. He'll be afther
                  gettin' the cows now." And, as if the matter were 
finally settled, he languidly wiped another glass.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Not being willing to wait, I went out 
through the driving rain and brought up my sodden properties. As I 
climbed the slippery
                  bank, I heard loud peals of laughter above me, and, 
looking up, saw a girl about seventeen who was evidently enjoying my 
struggles
                  with the luggage and the mud. She was the landlord's 
daughter— as she told me after she had laughed sufficiently at the 
appearance
                  of the wet luggage. Her name was Gladys Ethel, and, 
even in this house of wild disorder, she was a unique figure. Jet-black
                  masses of tangled, touzled hair fell upon her 
shoulders and straggled over her face. Her mane had probably never been 
combed,
                  and nothing but a garden rake would have gone through 
it. Her face was dirty, and the unlaced boots that hung on her 
unstockinged
                  feet had the tongues hanging out, while the laces went
 clickety-clack as she stamped along the echoing floor. Large teeth,
                  a loose, thick-lipped,<span class="pb"> [PAGE 86] </span>open
 mouth, and large, staring blue eyes completed Gladys Ethel's outward 
personality.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I fled to my room to wait for tea, but 
when it came, it was not an unmixed joy. Pat Kelly stood at the head of 
the table clashing
                  a knife and fork together with a sound like a 
broadsword combat. In front of him were corned and roast beef, and, as I
 came
                  in, he was shouting loudly, "Now then, ye chaps; come 
in to tay, or divil a bite ye'll get." Mrs. Kelly, whose only toilette
                  had been evidently a couple of "snifters," sat at her 
husband's right, and was comporting herself with much dignity. As Pat
                  carved the food he cried out, "Now, what'll ye hov, 
misther? Cornbafe or mate?" but Mrs. Kelly corrected him sharply:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Pat Kelly, why d'ye be comincin' to 
ate like wan o' thim blackfellys? Why the divil don't ye be afther 
puttin' the Crass
                  o' Christ an the beautiful mate ye have forninst ye? 
Annybuddy 'd think ye wuz brung up like a haythen, so they wud. Put an
                  the Crass o' Christ this minit, I tell ye, Pat Kelly!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Och, I can't be bothered; let thim 
that wants put it an the'rselves." But Mrs. Kelly's company manners were
 not satisfied
                  until Pat mumbled a "grace"—"For what we are about to 
resave"—"Daddy, make Johnny kape still; he wants to go out an' play
                  futball"—"may the Lord make us"—"Ye're a liar!" said 
Johnny, in reply to the football accusation—"Amin. If ye don't kape 
quite,
                  ye divil, I'll trow the kyarvin'-knife at the head o' 
yez!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then the feeding began. Mick, who had 
got back with the cows, sat next me. He was aged, deaf, and dilapidated,
 and he shovelled
                  his food into his mouth with a knife and a stolid 
determination to lose no time Utterly oblivious of what was going on 
around
                  him, he did not hear Reginald Kelly, aged five, 
saying, "Mick, my soup too 'ot." Mick took no notice, so the boy, to 
prove
                  his words, ladled up a spoonful, and held it to the 
old man as a sample, but it spilled down his shirt-front. Again the boy
                  said, "Mickee, my soup too 'ot," and held out another 
spoonful, which was spilt also. At last the hot soup penetrated the
                  old man's clothing,<span class="pb"> [PAGE 87] </span>and,
 looking down, he discovered the boy giving him a soup bath. A sounding 
whack sent Reginald to the floor, and the veteran
                  resumed his shovelling unmoved till the boy came at 
him under the table and bit his leg. Mick replied to this with a 
terrific
                  kick, and Reginald was led howling away by Gladys 
Ethel, who promised him his tea in the kitchen.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">After tea a young man came to see 
Gladys Ethel, and sat beside her in a dark room off the bar. He was 
evidently a very devoted
                  young man, for loud smacks, as of kissing, were heard 
frequently, especially when footsteps approached the door of the room.
                  Everybody knows that a kiss broken off suddenly in the
 middle gives forth a sound like the first efforts of a pump-sucker
                  to draw water when the well is low. Kelly apparently 
disliked the youth, for he left the bar several times, and "hunted" him
                  with much bad language and some cuffs on the ear. But 
the lover was not the sort to be discouraged by any little thing like
                  that, for he invariably came back, and he and Gladys 
Ethel resumed their affectionate communings with renewed ardour. When
                  parent Kelly had "hunted" the young man for the fifth 
time, I judged a little fresh air would do me good. I came back from
                  my walk an hour later, to find Gladys Ethel's parent 
kicking the lover out for the last time, while Gladys stood at the door
                  and laughed loudly.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I went to my room and found, in 
addition to my luggage, a large, greasy swag and a black tin billy. This
 seemed to indicate
                  a room-mate, and was a distinct violation of my 
agreement, which was for a room to myself. I called Kelly, but he made 
light
                  of it: "'Tis only an ould frind of moine that kem in 
afther tay; he's a very 'quite' man, and shure he may as well be usin'
                  the spare bed as it layin' oidle." So, making the best
 of it, I turned in and was soon asleep, dreaming that wild mermaids,
                  with snaky hair, were chasing me all through Kelly's 
premises for a kiss.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I was awakened by Kelly's voice:</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"For Gawd's sake, Rine! do be quite; 
ye'll be wakin' the jintleman there."</p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 88] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">"T'hell wid the jintleman! Shure, I'm 
as good a man as him, an' betther too, for all I bruk me leg; wake him 
up an' I'll fight
                  him."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No, no! Go to bid, Rine, that's a dear
 man."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Wait till I show ye how I bruk me 
leg," said Ryan, whom I judged was the "quiet" man Kelly had told me of.
 He took off his
                  trousers and showed his skinny leg—bent, stiff, and 
knobby at the knee like that of a 'bus-horse. He danced around, clad 
only
                  in his shirt, begging Kelly to let him get at me. He 
would show me his leg, and then fight me for drinks all round. I thought
                  it best to sham sleep. Eventually he fell into 
slumber, and I followed suit. Kelly came in half-an-hour later and woke 
me
                  up to say that Ryan was now quiet, and that I might go
 to sleep without fear of further disturbance. I daresay I should have
                  found that out myself, but Kelly evidently meant well.
 About five in the morning, loud shouts and sounds as of someone being
                  strangled awoke me, but, to my relief, it was only 
Ryan snoring and probably fighting me in his sleep.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Finding it impossible to doze off 
again, I got up, dressed, and went to the parlour to read. An hour later
 Gladys Ethel, mooning
                  sleepily down the passage, saw me and came in smiling,
 showing a wealth of mouth that in the morning light looked appalling.
                  She had not washed her face, and her hair was even 
wilder and more matted than before. Also there were some bits of straw
                  and feathers among the locks—which, no doubt, the wind
 would blow out later in the day.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The next time I went that way I camped 
out, but a passing swagman told me Gladys Ethel was married. It seems 
that Kelly, being
                  very busy in the bar one night, neglected to kick the 
lover out as often as usual, and when he did go into the room the pair
                  had eloped together. I also heard on bad authority 
that Gladys unaccountably reformed after marriage, and kept herself 
reasonably
                  clean, and wore stockings, and fixed her mane in a 
knob at the back of her head. But this statement rests on no 
satisfactory
                  evidence.

               <p class="noindent">THERE was moonlight on the water. The
 wind blew cold from the south-east and sent a gleaming ripple across 
the bay. Far out
                  the dark outline of an island stood in silhouette 
against the sky; and from the bush came the plaintive cry of the curlew.
                  A narrow jetty ran away out to the deep water. Upon it
 a man sat fishing; his line loose in his hand and a deep frown upon
                  his forehead.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Fate had been cruel that day. The man 
had told himself in the morning that he would confess his love to the 
most adorable

               <p class="normal">But circumstances conspired, and he had
 found no opportunity to speak with her alone. And now, as he sat 
looking down at the
                  shadows on the water, he heard voices—a man and woman 
were singing, away up at the hotel on the cliff. The voice of the man
                  was that of his dearest friend, and the woman's voice 
was the voice of her he loved.
               </p>

music, of poetry, of love;
                  and he knew as he listened that he had only dreamed of
 happiness.

               <p class="noindent">THEY had been engaged for a year and a
 half, but lately she had noticed that his love was beginning to cool. 
He never talked
                  in the old, rapturous way of "some day," and their 
daily meetings had dwindled down to weekly, without even letters 
between.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The last time she saw him she had 
noticed that her laughter and smart speeches jarred on him, and he had 
spoken in praise
                  of a<span class="pb"> [PAGE 91] </span>woman of their 
acquaintance with a soft, cooing voice. "Purring," the girl called it.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She expected him to-night, and had made
 up her mind for battle, and victory. She clad herself in her woman's 
armour—a dress
                  he liked the best, a clinging white cashmere that left
 her throat and shoulders bare. Her soft round arms and neck were her
                  strongest weapons, and she meant to use them.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She was sitting in a low chair when he 
came, and he noticed how the yellow cushion behind her head suited her 
eyes, her soft
                  brown eyes.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She rose as he came toward her and held
 out her hands with a glad gesture. "I knew you would come to-night, for
 I have been
                  thinking of you all day."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He sat down by the fire, but she did 
not go back to her chair. She stood behind him, her fingers playing in 
his hair in a
                  tender, motherly way. She did not speak for some 
minutes, but he could feel her heart against his ear as she leant over 
him.
                  It made it very hard for him to say what he had come 
to tell her. He wished he had written, or waited till to-morrow. Why
                  had she worn that frock to-night? He had not seen it 
for months. And why was she so soft and sweet to-night, when she had
                  been so different lately?
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Dear!"—her voice was a caress,—"why 
did you stay away so long? I have been <i>so</i> lonely." Her bare arm 
came soft and warm round his neck, and her cheek was laid on his hair.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He could never tell her like this. He 
must do it at once.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He got up quickly and walked across the
 room and back again. She stood watching him with a hurt, wondering 
look.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What is the matter, Jim? Something is 
troubling you. Have you anything to tell me?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yes, I have. Won't you sit down? I 
can't talk while you are standing there."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">She sat down in her chair by the fire, 
but he stood against the mantelshelf. It gave him courage to stand thus 
looking down
                  on her; and clumsily, in his man's way, he told her 
what he had come to say.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 92] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">It was just what she had expected. They
 had both made a mistake. ... They were not suited to each other. ... He
 had met another
                  girl, a little, fair-haired thing who was just the 
sort of gentle woman he wanted for a wife.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You are too clever for me, Joy, you 
know. You would soon grow tired of a big, stupid fellow like me. You 
want a man who can
                  talk poetry and metaphysics and stuff like that. And I
 want a wife who cares for home things more than books. You must see
                  that we have both been mistaken, don't you, Joy?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She sat listening, with her hands 
clasped before her, her eyes never leaving his face for one second. When
 he finished speaking,
                  she made just one little choking sound, and hid her 
face against the chair.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She did not speak at all, and he stood 
looking down at her, wishing she would not sit like that, wishing she 
would say something.
                  He had expected angry, cutting things; but instead 
there was silence, and that bent head. What a pretty head it was! The 
firelight
                  shone on the bright brown hair, and played in the deep
 ripples above her ear. Those ripples were never made by tongs or 
curling-pins,
                  and neither was that little curl that lay on her neck,
 and tried to hide the tiny mole. He remembered that mole so well. She
                  had always grumbled at it, but he had kissed it and 
called it her beauty-spot. How long ago that was! It was soon after they
                  were engaged; the night he had given her that emerald 
ring. He glanced at her hand hanging limp by her side. Yes, there it
                  was in the same place on her little finger—she would 
not have it on the third. Her hand would look strange without it, for
                  it was the only one she wore. It was a dear hand. Too 
thin for actual beauty, but soft and well-shaped; and, after all, he
                  did <i>not</i> like fat hands. Hers were firm and 
cool, and so comforting when one's head ached. Ethel's hands were such 
baby things, soft
                  and pink and kissable, but he liked a woman to have 
firm, strong hands best Joy's were strong He remembered how she had held
                  his dog the day the poor little brute broke its leg. 
She had cried so hard afterwards, too. He wondered if she were crying
                  now. Her<span class="pb"> [PAGE 93] </span>head was 
still hidden. Would she never look round! He could n't stand it much 
longer. He wanted to comfort her. That little
                  mole seemed to invite him to kiss it. He——
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She lifted her head and looked at him. 
Her eyes were wet, but they gleamed with a depth of love he had never 
seen there before.
                  All the sparkle had gone out of them, but something 
sweeter had come in. She rose and came to where he was standing.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Perhaps you are right, dear! I <i>am</i>
 too hard and worldly for you." Hard!—with that look in her eyes! "She 
will make the soft, yielding wife you want, and I know
                  you will be happy. We will say good-bye, and you must 
go away for a while, and then I shall get used to it—some day."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She was fidgetting with some violets in
 a bowl beside her, and he could see she had something more to say.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Suddenly she lifted her face to him and
 held out her hands.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Jim, Jim! kiss me just once before you
 go! You will be hers soon, but now you are mine still. I love you; oh, 
my dear, I
                  love you!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Her head was thrown back. Her red lips 
were parted in eagerness, and her eyes glowed with passion. She had 
never looked so
                  beautiful before. For one second he looked at her, and
 then ... one white arm was round his neck, her head was bowed on his
                  shoulder, and she had conquered.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">When he said good-bye, two hours later,
 it was settled that the wedding should be in a month.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I nearly made a big mistake," he said;
 "which only proves that I was right when I said you were too sweet and 
clever for
                  such an ass."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Her only answer then was a kiss, but 
when the door closed behind him she smiled at herself in the glass.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yes, he was right! I <i>am</i> too 
clever for him. It was a fine piece of acting, <i>ma chère!</i>"—with a 
little bow to her image in the glass—"and it brought down the house!"

Egotist.</h4>
               "E. &amp; O. E."
               
               <p class="noindent">HIS first impression on reading the 
letter was one of unreality. It had been lying opposite his seat at 
table, and, with a
                  premonitory chill, he had torn open the envelope and 
tilted back his chair to read. As in a dream he went over it again, but
                  a third reading accentuated the phrases and brought 
acutely to his mind all that the loss of her meant. He looked up to find
                  the others engrossed with their meal, and wondered 
angrily that there should be such indifference to his pain. Then, 
catching
                  glances in his direction, he crammed the letter in a 
pocket and made a pretence at eating, lest anyone should guess at his
                  discomfiture.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Dinner over, he hastened to his room 
and read her letter again and again, noting, through a maze of 
wonderment, here a trick
                  of words, there the lapse into an accustomed 
endearment. Sitting idly on the bed, he absorbed slowly the multiplicity
 of her
                  conflicting reasons, as also her confident assumption 
of his agreement in them; then wondered vaguely if he were hurt—if this
                  dull numbness meant bitter anguish, or merely 
emotional disappointment.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She was returning his letters and ring.
 He affected a contemptuous laugh—tribute to an imaginary audience. His 
ring! To be
                  treasured as the tombstone of his love? This, 
obtruding on his reflections as rather neat, he made a note of to use in
 his
                  reply.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He was taking it very well, he thought.
 Decidedly, there were few men who, loving her as he did—had done—would 
have accepted
                  the dismissal so philosophically. And, after all, 
there were compensations. Freedom offered a wider scope for enjoyment 
than
                  a life of domesticity. Some theatre-tickets and a 
tailor's bill stuck in his mirror suggested the fact that he had never 
denied
                  himself a pleasure. He met this with the reflection 
that future indulgences would be without conscience-qualms. He was 
tired,
                  too, of writing—of the weekly repetition of verbal 
caresses. She had complained of the coldness of his letters. But it was
                  impossible to be always at fever-heat. There had been,
 too, demands on his time and purse, which he had found it difficult
                  to explain or even specify<span class="pb"> [PAGE 95] </span>Women
 never understood these things. She wrote of the delay, the frequent 
postponements, and the long years of weary waiting.
                  Well, riches were not to be won in a day, and he was 
no selfish egotist to ask a woman to share poverty merely because she
                  loved him. That her younger sister and two girl 
friends had married in the interval had no bearing on <i>their</i> case.
 It was so like a woman's logic to quote these facts as it were in 
reproach to him. She had known at the time of their
                  engagement what his prospects were. He had been 
perfectly honest in defining his position. And if she had not been 
prepared
                  to wait, why had she——? The longer he considered, the 
clearer it became that she had treated him very badly. Still, she was
                  a woman. He would be generous with her.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The question of his reply came to him. 
This needed consideration, for it was imperative that she should 
recognise her position—and
                  her loss. It would be futile to pretend he had never 
loved her, just as it would be absurd to refute her arguments. Women,
                  he reflected, never reasoned.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Remembering she had always dreaded his 
sarcasm, he decided that an admixture of bitterness and cynicism would 
prove effective.
                  The desire to look well, to present the best possible 
appearance, was fast possessing him.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He was soon absorbed in the composition
 of his reply, almost to the exclusion of his earlier feelings. After 
many alterations,
                  he completed a fair copy, and read it over with 
satisfaction. A particular phrase fitted in so well with his admiration 
of
                  himself as to raise him almost to exultation.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Now, I call that good," he said, 
surveying himself in his mirror as though for confirmative applause. 
"Damned good!" A momentary
                  regret that he would not be present to witness its 
effect on her somewhat chilled his enthusiasm. Pride in his handiwork 
increased
                  till a craving for sympathetic appreciation dominated 
all his previous emotions.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I wonder if old Strong is in," he 
said, handling his letter with an almost caressing care. "I'll go and 
read this to him.

understood one another perfectly, and the silence was only broken by the
 droning hum
                  of London's traffic, and the rustling of the lace 
curtains in the soft June breeze that played with the girl's brown hair.
                  She was the first to break the silence:

               <p class="normal">"Kenneth, dear!"—the pencilled eyebrows
 arched inquiringly —"Kenneth, dear, how much do you love me? So much 
that nothing,
                  nothing, <i>nothing</i> could ever make any 
difference?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Nothing could: you know that well, 
little woman," he answered. "What's up with you now?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I'm so glad," she said. "I wanted to 
tell you something. I always meant to tell you, but somehow I couldn't 
till to-night.
                  Ken, there was a man once——"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Was there, really? I expect there were
 several men once, if you were like you are now."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No there were n't. There was only one;
 he made love to me, and I thought I cared for him; and I tried to show 
him how much
                  I cared. There was only one sort of love he seemed to 
understand, and I—I—oh, Ken, it was five years ago, and—you aren't 
angry,
                  Ken, darling, are you?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The man's face was chalk-white.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">In the silence that followed the girl 
thought she could hear her heart beat. Then the man slowly and 
deliberately took the
                  diamond-and-turquoise ring from her finger—and left 
her.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He turned at the door, and looked at 
her. "You've spoilt my life," he said. "Good-bye!"</p>

looking at the muddy river.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Two tenners is n't much," he said; and

               <p class="noindent">SHE was a sort of experimentalist in 
emotions, and she was lonely. Teaching in the backblocks sharpens the 
flirtation-palate
                  of a pretty girl, and does not decrease her 
possibilities.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">As regarded this particular victim, she
 had not meant to go further than an experiment. He saw things 
differently.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He was only a "cocky," with little 
brain beyond sheep; and she was rather a clever girl, with no desire for
 settling in life
                  at twenty. What tempted her into mischief was his 
size—he was one of those tall, strong, hot-tempered male animals who 
always
                  seem to appeal to small women.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">They were returning from a ride one 
afternoon at sunset, when the plains were tenderly tipped with violet 
and gold. He was
                  thinking of her; she was thinking of the other man—in 
Sydney.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I am not going to fall in love with 
you." The suddenness of the remark aroused her; its piquancy startled 
her.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No?" she queried tentatively. He was 
silent.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The girl laughed softly as she hummed, 
"Nobody asked you, sir, she said"; at the same time steadying her horse 
to a walk.
                  The experiment was promising, she reflected, and she 
wanted the full measure of its sensations. When you have a fly on a pin
                  you should watch it wriggle, and enjoy yourself.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He looked at her suspiciously, with an 
uncomfortable idea that she was laughing at him. Very likely she was: 
she never took
                  these impressionable men seriously.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Pretend you didn't try?" he suggested.
 She shook her little head with sudden gravity. "You do not understand 
me—dear!" She
                  said the last word softly, daringly.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">When they reached home, and he was 
lifting her from the saddle, he suddenly kissed her. What came over her 
that she did not
                  protest? She could not understand: she was generally 
particular in these matters. Besides, she was curiously cold-blooded,
                  and so never attempted to lose her self-respect. The 
man was trembling—things were getting beyond a joke for him.

               <p class="normal">A few days after, he called again. She 
was very subdued, and more puzzling than ever. She was lying in a 
camp-chair on the
                  verandah, dreamily watching the shadows chasing each 
other in and out of the straggling belt of timber in the distance.

half-frightened at the expression on his face.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"For what?" she said, shrinkingly.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Well, you let me kiss you; you know 
what <i>that</i> means!" His voice sounded like a threat.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She looked up at him thoughtfully; the 
tall, well-knit figure pleased her—one part of her; but the narrow 
forehead and general
                  unpolished look about him offended the other part of 
her. "I don't see how I could prevent you," she ventured audaciously.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He literally gasped: "Why, you never 
tried!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I was too hurt," said the girl, with a
 pretty air of dignity.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">His face grew absolutely miserable; and
 she became afraid that compassion (a frequent and unsuspected foe to 
some women) would
                  master her wisdom. She took a mental leap into the 
possible future. She saw herself his wife and him the father of her 
children.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">That thought saved her. It had been an 
interesting experiment, and the fly had wriggled beautifully; but 't was
 time to kill
                  it.

 glamour was upon them. She was simple and unsophisticated; he,

misunderstanding. The "eternal love" of a boy and a girl became a thing

 was a single<span class="pb"> [PAGE 100] </span>occupant. She bowed and
 smiled as she recognised her fellow-traveller, then sank into a 
window-corner and tried to think of
                  nothing in particular as she watched the disappearing 
trees and cottages. It would take two hours to reach the next station.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">How long it was since they had met, and
 how dear he had been! Even now she could feel his lips upon her hair, 
and his strong
                  hands imprisoning hers. She glanced towards him. What a
 look of pain was on his face! He, too, must be thinking. Again she
                  looked. Without a word he held out his arms. Ah! how 
sweet the time when she could creep into them as into a sheltered fold.

               <p class="normal">Suddenly the weight of years rolled 
from her. She was a girl again, and he her king. Throwing aside her 
heavy cloak she swept
                  towards him with a sob that was almost a gasp, and the
 next moment was folded close in his embrace, her face buried on his
                  shoulder.

me! I <i>did</i> kiss Charlie on the balcony that evening; but I never 
thought such a slight sin would bring so great a punishment."

               <p class="normal">"My love!" he answered, "at last we

               <p class="normal">"At last!" she echoed, as she held up 
her red lips for a kiss, and almost unconsciously pushed the brown curls
 from off his
                  forehead as in past days.

fair face, joined her husband and children on the platform.

They met; and with a great ache she recognised that her lover had died
                  with her youth. The man who stood in his place was an 
alien and a stranger. The faint mannerisms he possessed in old days
                  had become decided habits. Where a dimple had been on 
the boy's face a wrinkle lay in the man's. She had grown more fastidious
                  and<span class="pb"> [PAGE 102] </span>discerning. He 
had grown less so. She had ripened and enriched; he had ceased growing 
with her last knowledge of him, and
                  was perfectly satisfied with himself. She looked into 
his changed, shallow eyes with a breaking heart, and said to herself,
                  "What matter? Love is all. For life or death I am his.
 He has needed me. That is all. I will take his life again, and Paradise
                  will come back to the earth."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Surely you will never marry him?" said
 her friends, guessing her thoughts. "'T would throw away your life!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Love is all!" she said.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">One sweet, dark evening he walked home 
with her. His manner had the old tenderness, but none of the old doubt. 
He drew her
                  hand through his arm. She permitted it. Then, for the 
first time since their meeting, he spoke of the past.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I believe you loved me then," he said.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"And you?" she queried.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You know!" he answered, softly. For a 
thrilling second the past lived again. "And you?" he insisted.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then she flung off her long, maiden 
silence, and spoke: "I loved you—God knows I did!" There was something 
of the wail from
                  the dead in it. Nevertheless, it was the supreme 
moment of her life. She soared into heights unguessed—far, far from the 
man
                  at her side.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">For the first time his complacency was 
disturbed. "I was not worthy," he whispered.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">She answered with sweet scorn: "A man 
must be honourable."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"But you heard something about me?" he 
insisted.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Nothing."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I thought you might have heard some 
gossip."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Well, I would have been married, but 
there were difficulties in the way. She thinks a great deal of me."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">In a waking dream she heard such 
sentences as: "When a fellow looks for a home" ... "She is awfully fond 
of me." Her senses
                  came back as she heard him say: "But I wouldn't like 
to<span class="pb"> [PAGE 103] </span>think I had done you any kind of 
wrong. You see, women are not like men. They hold on to things; but a 
man forgets. You don't
                  think I have hurt you at all, do you?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She looked at the familiar scene. The 
scent of lilac suffocated her. The past stabbed her. She knew what a 
paltry lie love
                  was
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No," she said.</p>

 Out.</h4>
               T. H. Prichard
               
               <p class="noindent">I WALKED the verandah of my bungalow 
on Moto Ko Buli plantation, Sarawaga river, island of Vanua Levu, Fiji, 
impatiently waiting
                  dinner. It was longer than usual in coming, and more 
than once I had shouted to Lonea, the cook, to hurry up, receiving 
always
                  the stereotyped answer, "<i>Io, saka, malua 
vakalailaie!</i>" ("Yes, sir, wait a little.")
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Suddenly, after a longer pause than 
usual, Lonea bounced on to the verandah in a state of wild excitement. 
His eyes flamed
                  and his breath came fast as he asked:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Did you eat any of your curry, sir?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Eat any of the curry! How could I when
 you haven't given me a chance? But, see here, my friend, if it isn't on
 the table
                  smartly, by the Lord I'll eat <i>you!</i>"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Utterly disregarding the terrible 
threat, Lonea only rapped out, with rising anger, "Then it's some of 
those——niggers!" (using
                  the last epithet of contempt one "nig." can hurl at 
another).
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What's that? What have they been up 
to?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Eaten your curry! Come and see."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Now this was a serious matter, and with
 an energetic "The devil they have!" I followed Lonea to the <i>vale ni 
kuro</i>. There, sure enough, stood the dish of curry that would in its 
perfect state have adorned my table and progressed gently
                  through my digestive apparatus—but what a wreck!
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Half the contents of dismembered fowl 
had disappeared, and in the rampart of rice by which it had been 
surrounded there were
                  unmistakeable marks of the thievish fingers which had 
made free with the greater portion. My dinner was spoiled.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Who did this?" I asked, wrathfully.</p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 105] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">"I don't know, sir; but one of those—Ra
 men, I think."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Were they about here?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yes, sir."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Who?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Masid, Taniela, Warri, Tioni, Radovo 
and Taviuni."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Any in the kitchen?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Not while I was here, sir."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Well, you go to their <i>bure</i> and 
tell them all to muster on the verandah at once, if they don't want me 
after them; and send me your chief, Rogo."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Tanna men are true as steel in a fight.
 They will stand to you like white men. Rogo came and quickly took my 
instructions,
                  and I then went to make my own preparations for 
dealing with the culprit among the Ra men; for this offence, combining 
theft,
                  sacrilege and insult, had to be promptly avenged.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The Ra men were not long in answering 
the summons, and, having strapped on my revolver, I lined them up 
against the rail.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">All were there; twenty bronze figures 
perfectly nude but for the <i>sulu</i> around the loins.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then Rogo and his ten Tanna men, fully 
armed, quietly appeared and took up a position at a little distance; so 
that when I
                  began my harangue on the enormity of the offence 
committed, and expressed my determination to discover and punish the 
culprit,
                  the Ra men felt that I was in earnest.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I told them white men had means of 
detection about which ignorant <i>Ra Viti</i> knew nothing, and that I 
was bound to find out the thief. Of course, all loudly protested 
innocence and denounced the offender.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then the <i>séance</i> commenced.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I first went down the line looking for 
curry sign, making each one open his mouth. The draw was not altogether a
 blank, but
                  it afforded no positive proof.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Now," I said, "I am going to show you 
how a white man finds out a thief, and woe to him who tells me lies."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then, commencing with the first man, I 
clapped my hand on<span class="pb"> [PAGE 106] </span>his bare chest, 
over his heart, and sharply asked, "Did you eat my curry?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"<i>Segai, saka, au bubului ki na Kalou
 dina au sega ni kunia</i>." ("No, sir; I swear by the true God I did 
n't.")
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Did you? Did you? Did you?"—and the 
answer was repeated all down the line, while the heart-beat under my 
hand was but normal.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then I came to Taviuni (so called 
because he had long lived on the island of that name). "Did you?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No, I swear—!" But the thump, thump, 
thump of his heart under my hand told a different story, changing 
suspicion into certainty;
                  and he turned the yellowy-white colour of dirty fat as
 I thundered out—"You lie! Here, Lonea, bring me that <i>bilo</i>."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Lonea brought the cup in which I had 
prepared a gentle dose of ipecacuanha out of the medicine-chest.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Now, drink this!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">At first, Taviuni refused, believing he
 was to be poisoned outright; but, by tasting it myself and showing him 
the revolver,
                  I at last induced him to reconsider his decision.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He drank, and we all waited results. 
Presently he turned to go.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Stop there!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"<i>Au tauveimate, saka</i>" ("I'm 
unwell, sir.")
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"All right—stop there."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"<i>Au via lua, saka!</i>"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"All right. <i>Lua</i> where you are!" 
And—ye gods!—he did.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">There were one or two premonitory 
throes; then a mighty convulsion of the whole man; and—well, everybody 
soon knew who stole
                  the curry.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The man's discomfiture was his 
sufficient punishment; but the story flew far and wide, and I became 
speedily famous as a mighty
                  medicine-man on the strength of the way in which I 
bowled out Master Taviuni.

               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 107] </span><h4 class="normal">Nell's
 Letter.</h4>
               W. B. Young
               
               <p class="noindent">SHE had been standing at the open 
door since her brother's early breakfast. The breakfast-things were 
still on the table,
                  just as Bob had left them; but her own tea was now 
cold, and her bread and bacon remained untasted. Before her lay the 
dreary
                  panorama of ridge and gully, clothed with 
poverty-stricken gum-trees, which is common to the northern slopes of 
the Blue Mountains.
                  The persistent monotony of the sky-line was broken 
only by the barren effort of Mount Hay towards individuality; and at 
this
                  distant land-mark Nell was frowning through the 
sunlight, her eyes set in an unseeing stare.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She was thinking about a letter. It was
 not one she had received, for she had never received a letter in her 
life; but one
                  she felt she must write. Was it not nearly six months 
since Jim had gone away?—yet no word had come to her of his doings or
                  intentions. It was nearly summer again, and she had 
told herself all along that with the summer Jim would certainly return.
                  Not that she blamed Jim; for it was absurd to suppose 
that Jim could know of her trouble, seeing that when he went away she
                  did not know of it herself.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She passed her hand wearily over her 
brow, for she had been thinking deeply, and she was not used to 
thinking. She felt that
                  the letter would be difficult to write. Of course it 
was for Jim—her hero, Jim—who never laughed at her blunders; yet even
                  with Jim it would be hard to choose her words. For 
Nell, though simple, was not stupid. She was instinctively modest; and
                  then she knew she must not hurt Jim's feelings, or say
 anything that might be taken as an appeal to his generosity. Because
                  Jim was a gentleman, a real gentleman, whose words or 
actions must never be called in question.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 108] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">So, having thought it all out in her 
own little way, Nell went inside and cleared away the breakfast-things. 
Then she took
                  the bottle of violet ink, and the pink paper with the 
blue lines, and the ornamental pen with the impossible point. She spread
                  them laboriously before her on the table, and sat down
 with her back to the light to accomplish an act of common justice to
                  her lover. Pausing often for inspiration, she tried 
hard with her stiff little fingers to keep the wayward, spluttering pen
                  within the limits ruled for it. Dip succeeded dip in 
the narrow-necked bottle, blush followed blush over her freckled face,
                  sheet after sheet of the pink paper was spoilt and 
thrown aside; and before the task was done the afternoon had come and 
the
                  writer was nearly exhausted. When her name was duly 
signed she rose and stretched her limbs, cramped by the unaccustomed 
labour.
                  As she moved about the room, preparing for what should
 have been her mid-day meal, she was able to look back upon her efforts
                  with something approaching complacency; having, as she
 hoped, explained the situation without affront either to Jim or to
                  herself.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">When she had taken some tea and food, 
she drew from her pocket a crumpled old envelope. It contained a 
collar-stud and other
                  trifles, relics of Jim, and bore the address:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">MR. JAMES O'LYON,</p>
               
               <p class="normal">POST OFFICE,</p>
               
               <p class="normal">COOKAWARRA.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">This envelope she had found on the 
floor after one of Jim's visits. She had preserved it as a keepsake; but
 now it was the
                  only link between her narrow life and the great 
outside world into which her lover had withdrawn.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">So Nell copied the address upon a 
tinted envelope, tidied her wavy hair, and set out with her letter to 
the town, carrying
                  an old shawl over her arm, though it was not cold and 
the sun was still high. It was with a feeling more nearly akin to 
happiness
                  than she had enjoyed for some time, that Nell followed
 the winding track from the selection to the town and back again. That
                  night she<span class="pb"> [PAGE 109] </span>prepared 
her brother's tea and endured his ill-humour with comparative serenity, 
comforted by the thought that everything
                  would soon be right.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Six weeks had passed, yet no answer had
 come from Jim. In spite of herself, Nell was losing heart. Since the 
despatch of her
                  letter, she had walked daily to the post-office to 
enquire for an answer; trudging the three miles and a half into the town
                  with faint hopes, and the three miles and a half back 
again with ever-deepening despair. At first, on fine days, the walk
                  was not unpleasant; but, as weeks went by and the sun 
grew hotter, the exertion began to tell upon her. Her head was always
                  dizzy, and sleeplessness was wearing her down. There 
came a day when she fainted on the road, and lay some time unconscious.
                  She crawled home with difficulty, and next morning she
 felt too weak to rise from bed.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">So far, she had succeeded in hiding her
 trouble from her brother; but in her weakness and helplessness she made
 up her mind
                  to face the worst, and tell Bob all about it. So the 
following morning, when Bob was breakfasting in moody silence, she 
commenced
                  her faltering tale. It was some time before her 
brother grasped the situation; but when at length he did understand, he 
vented
                  his passion in a torrent of abuse. He even struck her;
 for brutal and vulgar minds, when by accident they find themselves
                  on the side of respectability, forego none of the 
privileges of the position. When he thought his taunts had begun to lose
                  their sting he left her. On his return at night the 
house was empty. Nell was gone.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The train sped on through the night. It
 was just daylight when Nell, shaken and feverish, left the carriage at 
Cookawarra.
                  For many hours she had not tasted food; her head 
throbbed; and she could scarcely stand. The station-master noticed her. 
"You
                  seem ill, miss," he said; "would you like to sit down 
in the waiting-room for a few minutes?"
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 110] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">Nell thanked him, and turned to follow,
 then tottered and fell. When she came to, she was lying on a sea in the
 waiting-room, and the station-master was holding a glass of water to 
her lips. "Are you better now?" he asked kindly.
                  "Yes, thank you," she said feebly. He left her for a 
moment, and returned, saying, "Sit still a while, and rest yourself.
                  I've brought you the paper to look at." She thanked 
him wearily and sat up. He went out, closing the door behind him, and
                  when he had gone Nell took up the paper, and almost 
immediately her eye met this paragraph:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">CAUGHT AT LAST.—When going to press we 
were credibly informed that, owing to the praiseworthy endeavours of 
Constable Bolger,
                  the notorious swindler, James O'Lyon, has again been 
brought within reach of the law. He is now in the lock-up, and will be
                  brought up at the police-court this morning. A full 
account of the proceedings will appear in our next issue.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">With a terrible jump at her heart, Nell
 realised what this meant to her. She was helpless, homeless, almost 
penniless, and
                  her darling Jim was in prison, charged with—she knew 
not what—some terrible mistake—of course the charge was false! But how
                  long would it take for Jim to clear himself? And what 
should she do in the meantime? Instantly she made up her mind to go
                  straight to the lock-up, and to see Jim, if only for a
 minute. Poor old Jim!
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">So she enquired her way from the 
friendly station-master, and slowly walked down the quiet street, gazing
 absently about her.
                  At last she reached the lock-up. It stood by itself on
 the other side of the town—a rough, wooden building, bare and 
forbidding.
                  A short distance away was the constable's house, 
enclosed within a neat fence along which honeysuckle grew thickly. Nell 
walked
                  boldly in and knocked at the door. No one answered, 
and she knocked again. Still there was no answer, and Nell bethought 
herself
                  that it was little past five o'clock. If she disturbed
 these people they would be offended, and she must avoid giving offence
                  if she wished to see Jim. She walked aimlessly out 
through the gate, and round the corner of the honeysuckle hedge, casting
                  many wistful glances at the lock-up She would sit down
 and rest—her head ached so. She heard the distant jangling of 
cow-bells,
                  the cry of magpies, and all the sounds of early 
morning, while from the honeysuckle overhead<span class="pb"> [PAGE 111]
 </span>came a perfume which she inhaled greedily. Then a drowsiness 
overtook her, and she slept.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Constable Bolger had been obliged to 
postpone the official overhauling of the prisoner's person, and it was 
about eight o'clock
                  in the morning when he came out of the lock-up with a 
letter in his hand. It was, of course, the constable's duty to read
                  over any papers found on a prisoner, so, bracing 
himself to carry out the work he had so well begun, he seated himself 
upon
                  a comfortable garden chair beneath the honeysuckle 
hedge. Having carefully lighted his pipe and spread out his feet to the
                  sun, he devoted his attention to the letter, which was
 queerly written on pink paper with blue lines, in wayward violet 
characters.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">It is certainly a very funny 
composition, for Constable Bolger rolls about on his seat as though a 
fit were imminent. Now
                  he has read it through, and looks round for someone 
with whom to share his enjoyment. Surely that is Banks—there, by the 
lamp-post!
                  "Holloa there, Banks!" roars Bolger. "Coo-e-e! Come 
here; I want you."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Banks seems deaf, and the constable 
roars again. On the other side of the hedge a tired girl opens her eyes,
 and tries to
                  rise. But her head is whirling—she seems to have no 
power over her limbs—she will lie down again—in a little while she will
                  feel better.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Now, then, just listen to this!" 
chuckles the constable when his friend is seated comfortably beside him.
 "Listen to this!
                  'My own, dear, beautiful Jim.' Eh? All right; it's 
only the cows. Never knew Jim O'Lyon, did you, Banks? 'My own, dear, 
beautiful
                  Jim.' That's him in the lock-up now. He's a dear, 
beautiful daisy is Jim: but wait. 'I hope this finds you in as good 
health
                  as it leaves me at present.' Hope it does, so help me 
three buck niggers 'Since you went away it has been cold mostly O, Jim,
                  what beautiful days them was before you went away.' My
 colonial troubles! Them was eight-hour days, them was! 'I'm not so
                  happy as I was, because Bob does go on so with 
drinking and<span class="pb"> [PAGE 112] </span>swearing and such like, 
and there ain't no one to say what you used to say.' No; strike me ugly 
if they can any of 'em put
                  it so genteel as the irresistible Jimmie! 'I lay awake
 at nights thinking of you know who.' O, my oath, Jim knows who right
                  enough! 'O Jim, if you was here I could tell you, but 
writing ain't the same, somehow.' Ha, ha, ha! Why, what's the matter,
                  man? What? Cry out? Why, it's only them cows laughin'.
 It would make a snake laugh! Sit down. It's nothing! Listen! 'But I've
                  told no one that you love me.' James has her on a bit 
of whipcord this time, and no mistake. Just listen here! 'O, Jim, 
sometimes
                  I think what mother would have said, but if she had 
known you she would say it was all right, 'cause you are a gentleman and
                  knows best. But, O Jim, do come and see me again in 
summer same as you did before.' Not quite. Probably James will have 
other
                  things to do this summer! 'With heaps of kisses.' Rows
 of ' Ha, ha, ha! Why, what's the matter, man? What? Cry out? Why, it's

                  of 'em; just look! What! Going? Well, so long!" And 
Constable Bolger went inside.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">On the other side of the fence a worn, 
pitiful figure lies still, very still. The cows are beginning to feel 
the growing power
                  of the sun, and graze closer in the shadow of the 
honeysuckle. One great brindled beast comes and sniffs at the sleeping 
figure
                  of the girl, then calmly crops a tuft of grass which 
her head is almost touching. She does not heed it; the hoarse, hollow
                  sound of the bell upon its neck does not seem to 
disturb her slumber.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She lies so very still.</p>
               
               <p class="padded">W. B. YOUNG.</p>
               
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 113] </span><h4 class="normal">Jessop's
 Coat.</h4>
               John B. Castieau
               
               <p class="noindent">JESSOP wore a new coat—a gorgeous 
garment bedecked with astrakhan, and beautified by moonlike buttons. It 
must have cost six
                  pounds. Lucky, luxurious dog, Jessop!
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Very different was the condition of 
Judson and Robins. They were two chronically moneyless bank-clerks, with
 a holiday, a
                  "dead bird" for the Anniversary Handicap, and not a 
copper to back it with. Standing at a street corner they discussed the
                  situation and every financial possibility, concluding 
reluctantly that they had neither cash nor credit. Suddenly Judson said:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Look at this blessed Crœsus coming 
along!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Who?" queried Robins.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Why, Jessop! with a coat on him like 
an Angora goat."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">With an air of envy and resentment, 
Judson and Robins watched the fine-feathered Jessop till he entered a 
lodging-house near
                  by.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I suppose we couldn't tap <i>him</i> 
again?" Robins murmured reflectively.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Tap <i>him!</i> No, indeed! If Jessop 
doesn't know us no one does. But, by Jove! I've got an inspiration. 
We'll borrow his coat."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You're a genius, Judson, I know," 
remarked Robins; "but I don't see what good that would be to us on a 
sweltering day like
                  this."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Couldn't we put it up the spout? 
Couldn't we get three or four quid on it? Couldn't we back Caravan with 
the stuff, make
                  a 'pony' each, and redeem the coat after the race? 
Couldn't we, eh?" broke out Judson like a dynamited note of 
interrogation.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"We could, we could," assented Robins, 
humbly; "but how'll<span class="pb"> [PAGE 114] </span>we get the coat? 
Jessop would know we had no need of it on a day like this."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"He wears it to show off. Why shouldn't
 one of us? But I've got a cat that will jump better than that."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Having thus sanely delivered himself, 
Judson's stock of sanity seemed exhausted, for he began to act in a way 
which Robins
                  liked as little as he understood. First, he wet his 
hand in the gutter, then he made for it a sort of mud glove by diving
                  it into the dust. That done, he deliberately printed a
 filthy impression of his paw fair in the centre of Robins' shirt-front.
                  Robins was just about to move round and curse at 
large, when the eccentric Judson remarked:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Now go and borrow Jessop's coat to 
hide your dirty shirt."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Judson," said Robins, feelingly, "you 
are indeed a genius. Let us go together."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">They went, and Jessop laughed very much
 at Robins' shirt-front, and said Judson was a wag. He was in a fine 
humour, and when
                  Robins mentioned his wish to have a loan of <i>the</i>
 coat, Jessop said:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Certainly, with the greatest of 
pleasure,"—and in a minute Robins was arrayed in half-a-hundred weight 
of coat.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Are you fellows going into town?" said
 Jessop. They were in South Yarra.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Er—yes!" said Judson, "we're going to 
walk." He thought that might deter Jessop, if he had a design to 
accompany them.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Oh, I'll walk," said Jessop.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">There was no escape, so Judson and 
Robins hypocritically ejaculated, "That's fine!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Long before they got to town Robins 
felt the weight of Jessop's coat, and perspired freely. He, however, 
consoled himself
                  with the prospect that they would soon get rid of 
Jessop, and, soon after, of his coat.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">When they reached the city they all 
stood, Judson and Robins expecting that Jessop would go his way, and so 
determine theirs.
                  They were, therefore, greatly perturbed when Jessop 
remarked, "Where are you fellows going to day?"
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 115] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">"Er—er," began Judson, desperately, "we
 were thinking of taking a stroll out to Coburg."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">That classic and compulsory resort of 
Victoria's criminality is a distance of five miles from Melbourne, and 
Judson mentioned
                  it with a view to Jessop's possible wish to join them.
 Great was the horror of the conspirators when Jessop said:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Well, I've got nothing else to do 
to-day, I'll go with you."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">To groan or make any other conventional
 demonstration would have been to betray themselves. They suffered, and 
Robins sweated,
                  in silence. Their only hope was to get it over, dodge 
Jessop, pawn the coat, and rush away to Williamstown in time to back
                  Caravan for the Handicap. They resigned themselves to 
Fate, and started upon the walk to which they had been so calamitously
                  committed. Jessop was in jubilant spirits, and rallied
 his friends upon their sudden depression.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">That tramp will live in the memory of 
Jessop, Judson, and Robins all their days, and it will be among their 
choicest reminiscences
                  of earth when they meet in "the great Perhaps." For 
the first couple of miles poor Robins got the worst of it, with the 
result
                  that Judson, simply through seeing another man in a 
more unpleasant plight than himself, gradually recovered his 
characteristic
                  cheerfulness. Robins perspired and grew very 
bloody-minded under his affliction. He knew there was a creek at Coburg,
 and
                  he commenced to plot a scheme whereby Jessop might be 
drowned in it. Several other murderous methods he discussed, mentally,
                  while Jessop and Judson made jokes and laughed. His 
condition was truly dreadful, but it was beautifully and almost 
completely
                  compensated by Providence.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">A thunderstorm gathered. The 
relentless, roasting sun became veiled by heavy clouds big with their 
terrible triplets—flash,
                  crash, and splash. There was a mighty kick-up, and the
 rain came down as if the River Jordan had found a crack in the sky.
                  Robins revelled in it. Jessop's coat was watertight.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Jessop and Judson were dumb and 
depressed. Jessop was<span class="pb"> [PAGE 116] </span>particularly 
annoyed. He cast furtive glances at his coat, and once or twice seemed 
about to say something. At last he blurted
                  out:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Look here, Robins, I don't see why I 
should get wet through while you're keeping yourself dry with my coat. 
You might be
                  gentleman enough to return it now that you see I have 
need of it."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"That be hanged!" retorted Robins. "You
 lent me the coat, and I want it as much as ever I did, and a great deal
 more."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">This delighted Judson, who made remarks
 calculated to make the disputants very angry. They warmed up until 
Jessop said that
                  Robins was "nothing but a low cad."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">This was altogether too much for 
Robins, who impulsively took off the coat, flung it at Judson (who 
immediately put it on),
                  and violently attacked Jessop. A fierce fight ensued, 
in which both belligerents got wet through, while Judson, cosy in 
Jessop's
                  coat, looked on, acted referee, and immensely enjoyed 
himself. Finally, Jessop conquered, which perhaps was only just.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The elemental strife ceased almost 
simultaneously, and when the sun came out again the steamy exhalations 
from the soaked
                  ground made the heat more oppressive than ever. Judson
 wished to return the coat to Robins. Robins couldn't see it. He was
                  covered with mud as a consequence of his combat with 
Jessop, but as they were in the country he did not mind that. Nothing
                  would induce him to again wear the infernal coat in 
such an atmosphere. It looked as if there would be another fight, when
                  a friend of Judson's came along driving a covered 
waggonette, and offered them a lift to town. This they joyfully 
accepted,
                  and soon were once more in Melbourne.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The necessity to get rid of Jessop was 
as strong with Judson and Robins as ever, and Jessop unexpectedly came 
to their relief.
                  He said he was going to have a shave, and asked if 
they would come in and wait. They went and watched Jessop get lathered.
                  As soon as he was thus secured Judson slipped out. 
Robins followed.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">At last they were free, and they 
hurriedly repaired to a pawnshop. Judson took charge of the delicate 
business, and when safe<span class="pb"> [PAGE 117] </span>within the 
curtained recess he exhibited the coat with the usual formula. The 
Hebrew proprietor closely examined the garment,
                  and then turned and ran his swivel eye down the 
stolen-property list. Then he called out "Nebuchadnezzar!" and a 
juvenile
                  Jew came, to whom the ancient one whispered a mission.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The unsophisticated Judson and Robins 
regarded all this as business, and were patient.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">At last the pawnbroker asked them, 
"Vadt you vandt on de goat?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Four pounds is a fair thing, I think!"
 returned Judson.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Thereupon followed the inevitable 
haggling, which was harshly interrupted by the entrance of two 
policemen, who exchanged
                  a few words with the Jew and then took the 
excessively-protesting Judson and Robins in charge for "larceny of the 
Chief Justice's
                  coat." This was, in two senses, "a bolt from the 
blue," and gladly would the astonished adventurers have made it so in a 
third
                  by a bold dash for freedom. But that was put out of 
the question by each constable seizing his man by the collar and running
                  him to the lock-up.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Judson and Robins were grievously 
pained by this indignity. They thought of Caravan. They also thought of 
Jessop, and wondered
                  in what mysterious fashion his coat was connected with
 that of the Chief Justice. This suggested to Judson the idea of sending
                  for Jessop and getting him to explain. He accordingly 
detailed to the sergeant a statement of how they had borrowed the coat
                  from Jessop, who had given them permission to pawn it.
 The sergeant listened with that incredulous air which does much to
                  create an impression of official wisdom in the minds 
of an awed public, and, with lightning rapidity based a "theory" upon
                  the prisoners' story. He decided that Jessop was an 
accomplice in the heinous crime of stealing the Chief Justice's coat,
                  and, having obtained his address from the 
too-confiding Judson, promptly ordered his arrest.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">In due course Jessop joined his former 
companions of the day, who explained that they had been walking along 
the street when<span class="pb"> [PAGE 118] </span>the policeman 
arrested them. In return, Jessop narrated how he had been struck with 
the Chief Justice's coat and had obtained
                  one exactly like it. This Judson and Robins rather 
resented, and they reproached Jessop with having indulged his vanity in
                  a direction which had brought them to such trouble.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">What might have been the fate of the 
unfortunates is not nice to surmise. What did happen is painful to 
relate. It gave the
                  sergeant such a shock that he had to be pensioned 
shortly afterwards. Standing at the watch-house door and looking along 
the
                  street he saw, being hustled along by a constable, but
 vigorously resisting and protesting, that Holy of Holies—the Chief
                  Justice. None other.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The sergeant, however, had his duty to 
perform, and with every expression of pain he enquired the charge.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Larceny of the Chief Justice's coat, 
which he is at present wearing," quoth the last man to join; and the 
sergeant sank down
                  upon a seat and begged to be excused.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">There was no need for the learned and 
outraged dignitary to explain. The sergeant divined all. The coat had 
been recovered
                  and restored to its owner, who upon again wearing it 
had been run in by the raw recruit.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">It took a great deal to pacify the big 
gun of the law, but he finally departed in peace. Shortly afterwards, 
Jessop, Judson
                  and Robins were released, Jessop keeping possession of
 his coat; and in much amazement at the ways of the law they went home.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">That night Judson and Robins read in 
the evening papers how Caravan had been beaten by a bare head. Then they
 silently shook
                  hands, and as one man blessed the frustration of their
 plot to hypothecate "Jessop's Coat."

               <p class="noindent">TE PAREHAO was a Maori chief, and Te 
Parehao had something on his mind. He made no sign, and worked away with
 spade and spear
                  among the gum-diggers as if his thoughts were as 
tranquil as usual. Toward afternoon, though, when chance threw him alone
                  with Herewini, the oldest, and therefore the most 
respected chief in Taiere, he made known his trouble quietly, and asked
                  advice.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Herewini was grieved beyond measure 
when he heard; but he alone could not give counsel in a case like this, 
he must consult
                  the other rangatiras of the settlement.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The meeting took place at dusk in 
Herewini's own whari. Five chiefs, all of high rank, were present. They 
sat silently round a fire in the middle of the floor, spitting into the
                  coals. Te Parehao, the sixth chief, and the one 
chiefly interested, was late in arriving; but he came at last and 
squatted
                  quietly by the fire. Then Herewini's voice called on 
him to make known the cause of this meeting; and the listeners moved
                  from the fire a little, and regarded Te Parehao 
expectantly.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He introduced himself warrior fashion, 
then reminded them that he had been husband four months to a woman who 
was very pleasing
                  to the eye; that she went away only yesterday to see 
her friends, who lived some two miles past the pakeha's house; and that
                  it was a moonlight night last night. Very well. He 
felt solitary, and went out He walked, he walked a long way, and at last
                  the home of the only white man in Taiere was before 
his eyes. Then was he coming back, but he saw through the trees a man
                  and woman going along to the house Ah! these chiefs of
 high blood before him would feel sick with shame, for the woman was
                  she to whom he<span class="pb"> [PAGE 120] </span>had 
been married four months: the man was that wicked pakeha! Well, they 
went in, and he waited and waited; and the moon had
                  gone down, and it was near the rising of the sun when 
the woman came out of the house and went back to the home of her 
friends,
                  two miles away. That was all his <i>korero</i>, and he
 would ask the wise men present what was to be done.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">An old chief cleared his throat and 
spat impressively into the fire. He had a few observations to make. In 
the first place,
                  the white man's punishment should be great, because he
 expected too much. Not only did they allow him two girls to keep house
                  and wash, but he frequently came and spent hours in 
the society of other women, and wrong was not thought of it. And now—a
                  chief's wife!—that was a step too high. Those were all
 his words.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The next gentleman agreed with all his 
learned friend had said. He suggested a form of punishment which, under 
similar circumstances,
                  has suggested itself to many nations, and waited. An 
older chief did not think the mode severe enough. What did the others
                  think? They left it in the hands of the chief whose 
honour had been injured. Would Te Parehao speak?
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Yes; he wanted the life of the white 
man and his mistress that night. As for the kind of punishment 
proposed—no, Te Parehao
                  would sooner butcher the white man outright. Plenty of
 supplejacks he would take to lash the two together; and he wanted help
                  to drag them to the coast. The sea was big—the sea 
might wash out their stain. First he would go to the house of the white
                  man, and tie him up; then away to where the woman was,
 and ask her to come home. The rest would be easy. Who would help him?
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Two of the strongest offered their 
services at once.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">It was moonlight, and nine o'clock; and
 the premises of Joseph Mackerrow, storekeeper, had been closed for two 
or three hours.
                  The owner himself had been out in the moonlight 
half-an-hour ago, but he had gone in, and now there was no light in the 
place.
                  No light, and no one about.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Hush! Was not that a woman who walked 
quickly up in the<span class="pb"> [PAGE 121] </span>pale moonlight 
toward the door, and opened it, and went in? And what of three figures 
that lay in the shadow of a clump of
                  blackishtrunked manuka trees huddled together near the
 house? It was hard to see them, no matter how you peered.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">It must have been half-an-hour after 
the woman went in when these figures got up and approached the door 
noiselessly. It was
                  unlocked, and in they went without a sound, each 
carrying a bundle of split supplejacks.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then everything was inanimate again.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Time passed. The place was now in 
shadow, now lit up, and again in shadow, as a few clouds straggled 
across the moon. When
                  at length all was clear, and she looked down, the 
three chiefs were out in front of the house once more; and on the ground
                  near them a man and woman lay in each other's arms, 
lashed together in half-a-dozen places. They formed a picture that 
seemed
                  to please Te Parehao's idea of revenge; for he 
regarded them often, and occasionally even spoke to the woman in Maori, 
to
                  the man in broken English.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">His wife of four months shed tears, 
only to be jeered at; and the gum-merchant was fast going into 
stupor—partly through fear,
                  and partly because the tight binding was beginning to 
affect his circulation.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">They made too heavy a load to drag, so 
their captors decided upon securing the services of a cart-horse. And 
then another
                  delicate question took a few minutes' consideration. 
Te Parehao wished to hook the traces in some loops of the supplejack
                  binding, and perform the journey without a sledge. His
 companions remonstrated; he would have no satisfaction when he reached
                  the coast. The way was rough, and it would kill them. 
Te Parehao gave in reluctantly. When all was ready to start, he stated
                  his intention of doing the rest of the work alone; 
rubbed noses with his two assistants; and started on his way merry as a
                  chief should be who is enjoying a thoroughly 
satisfactory revenge.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The moon had done three-fourths of her 
night's journey when he reached the coast, and the strong salt air came 
pleasantly
                  up over<span class="pb"> [PAGE 122] </span>the cliffs 
into his nostrils. He estimated the number of capsizes on the way to be 
three. He never looked back; but he heard
                  the thud when the sledge struck anything and turned 
over, and the groans mingling with the traces' rattle when the load 
possibly
                  caught against a stump, or helped the sledge over a 
boulder. Then, when the horse became quieter, he guessed the sledge had
                  got into its proper position again.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">At the commencement of a steep incline,
 that led down to a steeper cliff, Te Parehao stopped. He walked to the 
very edge and
                  looked coolly over.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Good enough," he said; and came back 
to relieve the sledge of its load.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then he uttered an exclamation. Either 
the supplejacks binding the two necks had worked loose, or the man's 
neck was broken,
                  for the head had slipped down and rested on the 
shoulder of the woman, whose eyes looked up now—not into her lover's, 
but
                  into her husband's. There was still life in her.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Spare me," she pleaded weakly, in the 
native tongue. "The man you would kill with me is already dead. Let me 
go; and forget
                  that you married me. I will go away; only let me 
live—let me live until my turn comes to die."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">For answer, Te Parehao lifted her 
partner's head and placed the face against hers.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Kish!" he said; "one good long kish."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">She did not speak, but when the head 
slipped to the side again, her eyes turned on Te Parehao with reproach, 
and the lower
                  part of her face was smeared with blood—blood not her 
own.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Here! here!" said the chief. "Sure you
 no sham?" and he turned the pakeha's face up.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Sham or no sham, one eye was glassy; 
and where the other should have been there was a simple hole. Blood ran 
from the mouth,
                  and clotted blood ran from the beard.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Ha! Never mind!"—and Te Parehao 
proceeded to undo the fastenings that bound the man and woman to the 
sledge. It did not take
                  long.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 123] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">"See!" and he pointed down the sloping 
bank, two hundred feet below the edge of which the sea lay, glistening 
invitingly under
                  the moon. "Quick way you go hell, eh? Me gi' you good 
shtart"—and he began rolling them over. Five or six turns sufficed;
                  then they kept on without assistance, and he stood and
 watched the result. Presently the pace became hot; and first the woman,
                  then the man, was uppermost, whirling over and over 
and hurrying to the edge.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">It was days afterwards, and the sea 
rolled in lazily. On the sand, a flock of birds of all sorts and 
conditions; in the water,
                  sometimes out of sight, sometimes almost wholly to be 
seen, as each wave curled over, something which interested these birds
                  greatly. A mermaid floating on her back with her lover
 in her arms? Perhaps so. At any rate, an old and dissipated-looking
                  bird, watching with the crowd, turned to his better 
half and winked; at which she looked the other way, as a girl who 
blushes
                  modestly. Yet, when the waves had done with the two 
bodies, she was among the first to waddle hungrily for a closer 
inspection.

               <p class="normal">As he spoke he touched the electric 
bell, and a few seconds afterwards a trapdoor in the floor fell open, 
and a devil, burnt
                  to a rich terra-cotta by the eternal fires, shot into 
the presence of the Lord of Hell.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"How now, sir?" thundered the 
potentate; "do you think hell was meant to be an ice-house, that you let
 the fires down so low?
                  You seem to have mistaken your vocation. The whole 
stoking department ought to have been angels with white robes and crowns
                  of glory. What do you mean by it, anyhow?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The stoker-devil trembled like a leaf. 
"May it please your majesty," he said, "it isn't really our fault; the 
fact is, we
                  are running out of fuel."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What!" roared Satan, "running out of 
fuel, with the whole universe to draw on?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"We've been using ten constellations a 
minute for the last three million years," explained the stoker; "and now
 the supply
                  has given out. We kept the Milky Way till the last, 
hoping against hope, but this week we had to use it. We are running the
                  furnaces now with the Magellan Clouds, but the quality
 is none of the best, and we'll want a fresh supply in a few hours."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Search the ends of Space then!" 
exclaimed Satan; "there must surely be any quantity of constellations 
left."</p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 125] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">The stoker-devil shook his head sadly. 
"We've used 'em all up," he replied. "Our cinder-heap reaches to the 
farthest depths."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Search that cinder-heap then!" cried 
Satan; "plenty of suns and constellations may have been thrown out 
carelessly."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No," replied the stoker-devil 
despondently; "during the last million years the ashes have been 
carefully sifted, and all
                  burnable parts have been returned to the furnaces."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Satan ground his mighty teeth in 
despair. "This comes of damning too many souls," he exclaimed. "I begin 
to think that I was
                  far too active in the old days. If I had had any 
foresight at all I'd have let the parsons save all the souls they 
wanted.
                  Here I am brought to beggary in my old age—burnt out 
of house and home by a lot of miserable souls who have not the common
                  decency to thank me for giving them the chance. But I 
will not submit; I'll strain the universe through a hair-sieve before
                  I give up the game. Here, you!—turn out ten thousand 
of those Australian miners we damned in the nineteenth century. Tell
                  'em to prospect all Space. Tell them I'll give 
threepence each for planets, and ninepence each for suns—in asbestos 
orders
                  good for whisky at the refreshmentroom. And, while 
they are routing around, I'll see what I can find on my own account."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">At once the message clanged throughout 
hell, but before the order could be carried out Satan took a header into
 the depths,
                  on a quest of his own. In a few seconds thousands of 
eager souls swarmed out on to the clinker-heap. There they were, gaunt
                  and grim, seared by millions of years of searching 
fires, grilled for ages on the unmelting fire-bars of the inferno, 
racked
                  and torn by the tireless torturers, and hideously 
disfigured by a thousand endless and unimaginable torments. But there 
they
                  stood with the old prospecting fever still strong 
within them, and before them lay the biggest prospecting field ever 
offered
                  to the sons of men. There lay an apparently 
duffered-out universe, with just a chance that somewhere in it were 
constellations
                  every sun of which was worth a drink in the private 
bar of hell; and so, with a whoop that shook the grim portal of the 
inferno,
                  they dashed into Space.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 126] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">But little they reckoned of the task 
before them. For days they wandered, that troop of disconsolate diggers,
 and many a billion
                  miles they prospected without success. At last, when 
the search seemed almost hopeless, something huge and filmy hove in 
sight
                  on the great black wall of starless Space. With a 
simultaneous rush the prospectors went for it, and, hooking themselves 
on
                  by every available point, they dragged it, with a wild
 hurrah, through billions of miles of emptiness till they triumphantly
                  dumped it at hell's gate, and sent it bodily down into
 the furnaces.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">A stoker-imp rose up and thanked them, 
with tears in his eyes.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Just in time, oh, just in time!" he 
exclaimed, in broken accents. "The weather prophet in the third gridiron
 has prophesied
                  a white frost."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">But suddenly a mighty form spun up from
 the exterior darkness. It was Satan, returned from a fruitless search.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I hear the roar of the furnaces," he 
said; "what have you found?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">They told him.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">" 'A filmy thing, floating in Space.' 
Oh, fools!" he cried, "you have gone and burnt up Heaven. It won't last 
ten minutes.
                  We are lost!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">And, sure enough, fifteen minutes later
 Hell froze over.</p>

acknowledge one another before the world: have a pity for us the 
outcasts, who must meet
                  and vow eternal constancy in secret, whose love 
prudence or morals forbids. Your path is so smooth; you sit in snug 
drawing-rooms,
                  and discreet coughs announce the approach of 
intruders. Everyone smiles on you and approves of you. We must descend 
to artifice,
                  stratagem, and ruse. We advertise in the "missing 
friends" column, or hide letters in a log or a tree. You run to meet the
                  postman, and smile openly and happily over love's 
eloquence. You are artless, frank, sincere. We—well, never mind what we
                  are; the words sound harsh.

               <p class="normal">We meet by the grass-grown banks of a 
swift little creek, and from the shelter of tall bracken and rushes 
glance guiltily
                  now and again over our shoulders—at what? A cow or a 
horse. And we scarcely dare whisper as we presently approach the 
homestead,
                  and part under the shelter of that kindly old white 
gum. Or away on some lonely road, with not a habitation in sight, where
                  the acres of dim country seem to slip into the far 
horizon under the moon; the horses tied to the wire fence crop the 
grass,
                  and the sheep, huddled together, bleat now and again, 
and we start, fearing someone.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Or down by a cliff near the sea, the 
stars tracking a pathway across the water, which rises and falls, and 
whispers a crooning
                  song to the gleaming line of sand.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Or the city; poor lovers when it is the
 city! It is hard to find nooks for lovers in the city. In the big, kind
 country, when
                  the<span class="pb"> [PAGE 128] </span>night falls, we
 have the wide miles and each other. Yet even the busy streets become 
dear when we have trodden them side by
                  side, and the glamour falls over all that is prosaic 
and humdrum. But the marvellous charms of those secret meetings, the
                  hair-breadth escapes from discovery, the dear jeopardy
 into which Love leads us,—they are something you can never know, happy
                  lovers! Does not the very openness and smoothness of 
your path render it commonplace! Do you value the prize so easily 
obtained?
                  Do you really know what Love is? But what true lovers 
have not believed that to them alone has been revealed the length, 
depth,
                  breadth, height and vastness of Love?
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">We used to think we knew it all; even 
though we might not confess to each other, there were times when we 
believed we had
                  reached the perfect happiness. Life had been cruel, 
would continue cruel, but Love had given all, and you whispered, "If 
Death
                  would come now!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">But he did not come, and it has all 
gone far into the past, and we are humdrum, middle-aged people, and have
 not seen one
                  another for twenty years. If Death had come then, it 
would have been better. Poor lovers!
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">There was a row of pines away across 
the paddock, and one slipped with stockinged feet along the verandah 
where the boards
                  creaked, and down the lane so quietly, then past the 
sheds where a tall poplar dropped leaves that crackled underfoot. If
                  there was a moon one kept close to the straggling 
hawthorn hedge, pausing with rapid pulse to listen if anyone was 
near;—what
                  miles it seemed when every step was fraught with 
danger, and each movement was made with deliberate caution! Then across 
the
                  strip of open where white logs lay on the ground, and 
one lingered fearfully by stump and tree, past the clump of saplings
                  where sometimes hung a grave native-bear; the tall, 
pale grass on each side stretching away in soft, indistinct waves. Then
                  at last in the shelter of the pines, the dry ground 
beneath strewn with pine-needles, and the branches above murmuring a 
song
                  they long ago taught ships to sing<span class="pb"> 
[PAGE 129] </span>at sea. Perhaps the tall masts were stalwart pines in 
their youth, and can never forget the forest-song which sweeps through
                  solemn chant, murmuring dirge, requiem, lullaby, then 
swells into sonorous peal and blast of mad triumph or despair.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">One leaned against an old brown bole 
with its warm, resinous smell, listened and started at the falling of a 
twig; across
                  the quiet night came the far bark of a dog, the 
whirring of a cricket, the <i>womp! womp!</i> of frogs in the dam, and 
blended with all the whisper and croon of the pines. At last you would 
come, your steps indistinct,—a
                  moment of doubt,—then coming rapidly nearer. Then ... 
well, you who are lovers know what then.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">What a soft cushion pine-needles make! 
What a still, peaceful world we looked out on from the shadow while we 
talked of ourselves,
                  and our love, and the risks we ran, or did not talk at
 all—and often that was best. The minutes that dragged in a very 
eternity
                  of time while we were apart, were hurrying into an 
hour when we were together.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I was afraid you could not come."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I could not have stayed; my heart was 
beating in a very madness of longing for you."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Do they suspect, do you think?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I daresay. I do not care <i>now.</i>"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">A light twinkles far off—it is the home
 of a newly-wed pair.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Ah, my dear—shall we ever ... What is 
to be the end of it all?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I dare n't think of it. I only live 
for the present, and from one meeting to another."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Did you hear my step?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yes—far off. At first I thought it was
 only the pulse in my ears, but it came nearer, and you are here."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Well, it is all past now; hot clasp, 
passionate kisses, clinging arms. Judge not too harshly, happy lovers! 
We break our hearts,
                  you see, and must lie and play the hypocrite, and meet
 by stealth; and we try to do what is right very often, but, though
                  you may not<span class="pb"> [PAGE 130] </span>believe
 it, there are circumstances in which it is impossible to tell what <i>is</i>
 right. And Love is stronger than anything but Death, and perhaps it is 
stronger than Death also. Some day we shall know.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Meanwhile we meet by stealth, and some 
of us do our best in a hard place, and some of us don't; and when we 
suffer we wonder
                  vaguely why Love and "morals" are so often opposed. 
Yet, if you are severe to those whom Love tempts too cruelly, you must
                  also give credit to those—and they are not few—who 
withstand, and break their hearts. But, as they are probably broken 
either
                  way, it does not matter much.

               <p class="noindent">A NUMBER of Bungaree farmers, called 
from the fields, stood bare-headed about the sick-bed in attitudes of 
grievous constraint.
                  Mrs. Mooney, seated on a low stool, wept sluice-heads,
 with wailing and querulous protestations. She had been replenishing
                  the fountain of tears with whisky, and now cherished a
 great grievance against Malachi for dying, and the time chosen, and
                  the manner thereof.

               <p class="normal">Hogan gravely assumed authority over 
the jar, and filled up for the company with judicial impartiality.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Good luck to ye, Mullocky!" said 
Hogan, raising his cup.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Malachi waved his thin hand in 
expostulation. He was beyond all chances of fortune in this world, and 
knew it. Hogan temporised.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Good luck to ye, Mullocky, fwhere ye

her body to

               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The company drank with one action, 
quite military in its precision, and then looked towards Malachi Mooney 
for further orders,
                  and Malachi lay peacefully, happily dead with a smile 
on his lips, and the half-drained mug in his wasted fingers.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Oh, ye divil! t'be dyin' on me like

               <p class="normal">Presently, perceiving that Malachi was 
beyond argument, she lifted up her voice and filled the house with 
dolorous cries,
                  and<span class="pb"> [PAGE 132] </span>wailed 
dutifully and monotonously far into the night, when the chant was taken 
up by eerie, wrinkled old crones, smoke-dried
                  grandmothers lent for the occasion by sympathetic 
families from the four quarters of the wilderness.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">What a wake that was! It lasted all 
night, and right up to the time fixed for the funeral. There was no end 
to the willing
                  drinkers, and no limit to the whisky. Indeed, the 
miraculous manner in which tiny kegs, loaded to the bung, rolled from 
under
                  the bed on demand, confirmed the local opinion that 
"Mullocky" Mooney had more than a finger in the snug still, the smoke
                  from which curled so artfully up from a charred trunk 
on Peter's Hill, and was thoughtfully given a supernatural origin by
                  the neighbourly people of the district.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The funeral was advertised to move from
 the home of deceased at ten a.m. sharp. It was a long march to the 
Ballarat old cemetery,
                  and an early start was deemed necessary in 
consideration of the fact that Hooley's funeral, which happened a month 
earlier,
                  had been fined for furious driving, by reason of the 
anxiety of the mourners to reach the graveyard before closing time.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The vehicles began to arrive at seven 
in the morning, the farmers and settlers driving, and their wives and 
"childer" loaded
                  in behind. A funeral was a "trate" that didn't happen 
every day, and it would have been considered a sin to deprive the "byes"
                  and "gurrls" of a bit of "enjymint" that cost nothing.
 But many of the mourners had been at Mooney's all night, "kapin' the
                  carpse company," and daybreak disclosed a baker's 
dozen scattered about the farm, sleeping where they fell. One hung over
                  the dog-leg fence "forninst" the house, like an old 
shirt, with down-swinging arms. Canty, recumbent against the butt-end
                  of a gum, rigid as a stump, slept so profoundly that 
the old guttural Brahmapootra had perched on his bald and awful head,
                  and was defying creation with senseless repetitions of
 a cracked clarion. Others reposed curled against the house, and several
                  dotted the paddock like quaint hieroglyphics, objects 
of wonderment and noisy speculation to the familiar pigs.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 133] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">Michael Morrissey was the first to 
drive up. Michael was to occupy an honourable and responsible position 
at the head of the
                  procession. He had generously offered the use of his 
trap as hearse, and it was appropriately draped for that solemn office.
                  This vehicle was an American waggon, and it had been 
roofed over about two feet from the floor, and was ordinarily used for
                  the conveyance of meat; Michael being a butcher. There
 was a door at the back, and just room within for Mooney's coffin. 
Quinn's
                  trotter, The Imp, was in the shafts. The Imp had been 
borrowed for the occasion because he was the only black horse in the
                  district; but although his complexion was 
satisfactory, his disposition quite unsuited him for so grave a duty. He
 was old
                  and had a semi-bald tail; but there was a peculiar and
 aggressive jauntiness about the beast altogether out of harmony with
                  his years and the situation in which he found himself.
 He held his head high, and pricked his ears, and his tail had a perky
                  elevation that exhibited the bald butt to the worst 
advantage, and excited popular derision wherever he went.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">When the friends of the late Malachi 
Mooney arrived, they walked reverently into the room where Malachi lay 
still on the bed
                  amidst his monumental candles, and gazed on him for a 
moment with pensive sadness, as in duty bound.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Pore mahn, he have the peaceful shmile
 on him!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"He have, he have!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">After repeating the sentiment several 
times, with nodding heads and much wise clicking of tongues, thus having
 paid their
                  respects to the dead, they withdrew to the kitchen, 
and devoted themselves to the whisky.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The coffin had been delivered, and 
stood on two bush stools in the kitchen, decently covered with a black 
shawl. Mrs. Mooney
                  sat at the foot, adjacent to a pannikin, and continued
 to upbraid Mooney for his inconsiderate conduct in dying, and "lavin'
                  a lone lorn widdy."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The funeral moved at eleven, when it 
was quite certain that only one baby keg remained. This keg Morrissey 
took with him on<span class="pb"> [PAGE 134] </span>the improvised 
hearse, as a wise provision for the first half of the journey, which lay
 through a barren land.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Many of the mourners had to be helped 
into their vehicles, and after the start many remained in only by a 
miracle. Morrissey
                  led the way, The Imp stepping along with a frivolous 
kind of a four-footed jig that robbed the cortège at the outset of any
                  pretence to dignity. O'Connor's old waggonette 
followed, O'Connor driving carefully, strapped down; and Mrs. O'Connor 
and
                  the "widdy" occupying the back seat. Then came Clark 
in his spring-cart, driving The Imp's rival, Colleen. After him two or
                  three miscellaneous vehicles, and then a long string 
of wood drays, each in charge of an unnaturally rigid and solemn 
Irishman
                  perched on a candle box, and each containing one or 
two women and three or four children, the former squatting composedly
                  on the bottom of the dray with their substantial feet 
swinging out behind. A dozen sleepy, unshaven, unshorn agriculturists
                  brought up the rear, riding two abreast on large, 
morbid horses that shuffled moodily through the dust with drooped heads
                  and sagging under-lips.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The women in the drays maintained a 
shrill conversation along the line, but for the most part the men 
observed an owl-like
                  decorum until the Travellers' Rest was reached,—that 
is, if the puffing of abbreviated black clays be not considered 
derogatory
                  from true reverence. Meanwhile, the day being hot and 
the way dusty, a couple of short halts had served to drain the keg on
                  the hearse. It was a gritty, drought-stricken funeral 
that descended upon the Travellers' Rest, and when it moved again it
                  left the wayside inn as dry as a powder-mill, having 
drunk up everything in the bar, and demolished the water-butt.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">And now a great spirit of unrest took 
possession of many of the mourners, and there was much whooping and many
 manifestations
                  of a wild and unholy desire to convert the procession 
into something like a steeplechase. The Imp was stepping out gaily with
                  his deceitful double-shuffle, game as a pebble, 
despite his age and infirmities, but it was Clark with Colleen who led 
the
                  break-away.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 135] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">Springing up with a whoop and whooroo, 
Clark whipped his mare alongside the hearse.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Morrissey," he cried, "I can bate that
 bumble-footed ould crock to the Pint beyant fer tin bob!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Ye can't!" roared Morrissey, all the 
sportsman stirring within him.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Ye loi!" Clark fairly shrieked, laying
 the whip on.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Michael lashed The Imp, and the 
veteran, scenting a contest, snorted defiance, and hit out with all four
 afflicted legs at
                  once. Then, bounding over ruts, jumping the boulders, 
rocking and rearing, the two vehicles went thundering through the dust,
                  Colleen leading and The Imp following, flinging wide 
his legs with the action of a startled tarantula as he rushed down the
                  hill, his body working with the antic spasms of two 
pigs in a bag.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The other drivers flogged their stolid 
horses into unwonted activity, and in this way the mad funeral, strung 
out a mile long,
                  tore through one affrighted township, scattering sows 
and sucklings, goats, dogs, poultry, and shrieking children, raising
                  a dust that blotted out half the landscape, and 
filling men and women with a wonderment that lasted many days. Half a 
mile
                  beyond, The Imp, with a triumphant tail and starting 
eyeballs, flung past the Colleen with a rush and a roar, neatly carrying
                  away Clark's near wheel, which went humming ahead down
 the well-worn track.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Morrissey obtained control over his 
blood horse and succeeded in pulling up about a mile further on, and 
there he waited for
                  the rest of the funeral in a humble and contrite frame
 of mind. The procession arrived in sections, the heavy horses spent
                  and reeking, and the mourners coated thickly with 
powdered clay that caked rapidly in the sun on their perspiring faces. 
The
                  women, particularly the stout ones, tumbled and bumped
 out of all knowledge and restraint, were loud and fierce in their 
complainings;
                  and the men agreed that it was "ondacent" and "agin 
religion" to conduct a funeral at a hard gallop. So Michael led away 
again,
                  holding his trotter hard, and proceeded as reverently 
and demurely as possible with such a horse and so much whisky.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 136] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">Matty Clark was reported unharmed, and 
busy fixing a skid in place of the lost wheel. It was expected that he 
would turn back,
                  and be no more a disturbing element in his neighbour's
 funeral.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The procession travelled into the 
outskirts of Ballarat without any further misadventure. In fact, most of
 the drivers and
                  several of the ladies were asleep, and the weary 
plough-horses drowsed along at their own gait. The Imp, in spite of the 
apparent
                  spright-liness of his action, was a very slow walker, 
for the reason that he generally dropped his hoofs in almost the spots
                  from which he had just lifted them, and sometimes 
behind.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">But at this point, cries of warning and
 of wonderment and disgust ran along the line, and looking back, 
Morrissey beheld Matty
                  Clark in the distance, erect in his cart, 
gesticulating like a maniac, and rapidly overhauling the funeral. 
Matthew had fixed
                  a sapling under his trap for a skid, and on this and 
one wheel he presently rattled up alongside the hearse again, oblivious
                  to the threats and expostulations of the mourners.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Mike Morrissey, ye divil ye!" yelled 
Mat, red, panting, and furious, "to the cemmethry fer a quid!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Niver a won av me," replied Morrissey,
 hanging on to The Imp.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yis, be the powers!" roared Clark, 
shooting ahead, and slashing viciously at the hearse-horse as he passed.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Michael clung to the reins, and hauled 
with all his might, but The Imp was not to be denied. Squealing shrilly 
in reply to
                  the challenge, he broke into his old, ungainly, 
link-motion combination of canter, amble and trot, and spread himself 
all
                  over the road in pursuit of Colleen.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">A couple of horsemen put their nags to a
 gallop to head-off Matty Clark, and in this way the funeral broke in 
upon Ballarat,
                  careering down Humphrey-street, and stirring the city 
to its depths.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Fortunately Colleen was headed just 
before reaching the main thoroughfare, and Daly and O'Mara seized upon 
Matty, who was
                  a small, bristly Hibernian, and fought like a peccary.
 They got him<span class="pb"> [PAGE 137] </span>down and tied him up. 
Then, after throwing their turbulent captive into the cart, O'Hara sat 
on his chest and led the horses,
                  and Daly, driving Colleen, now blown and humbled, took
 up a subordinate position at the tail of the procession; while the
                  funeral, which had paused to collect itself once more,
 moved on, followed by a delighted crowd of children and many envious
                  adults.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Many astonishing funerals had come up 
out of Bungaree into Ballarat East, but Malachi Mooney's funeral was the
 most weird
                  and wonderful that ever invaded any town on the 
Australian continent, and news of it seemed to have electric passage 
through
                  the place. The improvised hearse with the 
well-intentioned effort to rig a pair of plumes of cock's feathers upon 
it, the
                  strange, jocund horse that hauled it, and the great, 
red, clayed-up, hairy, wild-eyed Galway man driving, were alone 
sufficient
                  to have brought the whole population into 
Bridge-street; but with the added attractions —the awful procession of 
drays, their
                  dusty, kiln-dried occupants, and the last vehicle 
riding jauntily on its skid, the funeral simply stopped business, took 
possession
                  of the town, and drew the people after it in crowds.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Morrissey had the reins wound about his
 wrists, and with his heels dug in, his eyes protruding, and all his 
faculties intensely
                  concentrated, hung to The Imp. The matrons still swung
 their stout feet, and here and there a worn-out mourner slept in his
                  dray,—Heffernan and Moore with their heads suspended 
over the tail and their mouths open. The police followed too, and eyed
                  the procession dubiously, half-inclined to arrest the 
whole funeral; but by exercising the severest self-restraint and the
                  greatest caution the mourners contrived to pull 
through, and arrived at the cemetery at half-past four, with the coffin 
in
                  good order and condition.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">After the usual preliminaries, the 
coffin was carried to the graveside by four of the late Mooney's most 
intimate friends,
                  and, considering all things, their progress down the 
path was not as devious as might have been expected, but they landed
                  the pine casket with a dump that produced the greatest
 sensation of the day. The coffin lid had not been screwed down, and
                  it slipped to one side,<span class="pb"> [PAGE 138] </span>making
 a revelation. There were many cries and much commotion when it was seen
 that the coffin contained packages of sugar
                  and tea and miscellaneous groceries, and nothing more.
 Malachi Mooney was not there! Consternation sat whitely on every face,
                  and the women crossed themselves vigorously.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"He's bin shpirited away!" wailed the 
"widdy."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Did annywon see us dthrop him?" asked 
the dazed Morrissey in a small, awed voice.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Flynn now remembered that he had packed
 the groceries in the coffin the day before. He it was who carted the 
casket out from
                  Ballarat; and, having goods to carry at the same time,
 he packed them into the "piner" for "convanience," and by reason of
                  the thirst that came upon him and possessed him for 
two days "disremimbered ivirything aftherwards."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">In truth the late Malachi Mooney still 
lay undisturbed upon the bed in his humble home in Bungaree, and the 
last of the yard-long
                  candles guttered in the brass-sockets at his head. <i>The
 corpse had been forgotten!</i></p>
               
               <p class="normal">And this is how Malachi Mooney came to

head, glancing fearfully from side to side at the ominous, lowering 
faces. All reviled
                  him; the women spat upon him; several of the men 
attempted to strike him. It was all the two policemen could do to save 
him
                  from the fury of the crowd. Presently stones began to 
fly. Most of them passed wide of the mark, but one of them found its
                  billet. He reeled as the missile struck him; then, 
recovering himself, he broke from his escort, and rushed wildly down the
                  narrow street, followed by a shower of stones and 
curses, and the execrating shouts of "Judas! Judas!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">It was the time of a great strike. The

               <p class="normal">It was reserved for one man to bring it
 home to them—one of their own number—a traitor—Judas! He was the first 
to fail, as
                  he had been the last to join them. In going back to 
the yoke and pittance, he paved the way for others to follow, one by 
one,
                  until it seemed as if the long slow weeks of suffering
 and self-sacrifice had been once more in vain.
               </p>

 the Law of the land—the Law which put forth all its powers to thrust 
them back into

 rebelled against it?

universal shout of "Judas! Judas!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Later he stands hatless, beneath a lamp
 in the deserted street. His face is smeared with blood where the stone 
struck him.
                  He has had more than one bitter experience this 
evening. Soon after he escaped from his pursuers he staggered, sick and 
faint,
                  into a hotel. The bar was filled with men, many of 
whom were strikers, though he failed to notice them till it was too late
                  to retreat. He reeled to the counter.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Give me some brandy, quick," he said, 
"for the love of God!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The bottle was passed to him in 
silence. The room had been filled with clamour when he entered; now an 
ominous silence prevailed.
                  He would have given worlds to search the assemblage 
for one pitying, relenting face; but he dared not lift his eyes. He 
hastily
                  swallowed the spirit and thrust a coin across the 
counter. Then a voice was heard.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What, Hennessy, would you touch his 
cursed silver—blood money?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The publican hesitated. His sympathies 
were with the men on strike, yet he could not help feeling some faint 
sense of pity
                  for the abject wretch before him. But pity at times is
 an unprofitable sentiment. He flicked the coin back again.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No," he said, "he has had the drink; 
but I will not touch his money!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Curse you!" cried the hunted wretch, 
as he shivered the glass upon the floor. "Oh, curse you all!"—and he 
rushed from the
                  place, followed by derisive laughter.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He is recalling the scene now, as he 
stands beneath the streetlamp, with the rain pattering upon his 
uncovered head.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"My God!" he cries, "I cannot stand 
this much longer."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Later still. He is walking, he knows 
not whither, although the street seems familiar. In truth he is close to
 the factory.<span class="pb"> [PAGE 141] </span>Suddenly he hears a 
sound of sobbing, A child—a little boy—is crouched against the fence, 
crying bitterly.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What is the matter?" he asks.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The child tells him—he is lost.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Come with me," he says; "I will take 
you home." He knows the boy—for more than twelve months he worked beside
 his father
                  in the factory.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The child gives his hand trustingly, 
and they go on together. A little further on he stops to look at his 
watch, and the boy
                  gets a glimpse of his face.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Instantly the child endeavours to wrest
 himself free, at the same time crying out, in terror, "Let me go!—let 
me go!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What is the matter?" he asks. "Come 
with me; I will take you home."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No, no!" exclaims the child, beating 
frantically the detaining hand, "not with you—I know you. <i>You are 
Judas!</i>"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Instantly he releases the boy.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Even the children!" he groans. "Oh, 
God, I am heavily punished!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He is at the door of his lodgings. 
Although it is very late now, there is a faint light within. He opens 
the door softly and
                  enters. As he is passing up the passage, the door of 
the sitting-room opens and his landlady calls him.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I have been waiting up for you, sir," 
she says as a beginning. "I am very sorry to have to do anything 
unpleasant; you have
                  been near two years now in my house, sir, but I must 
give you warning. You see, sir," she went on, seeing that he was about
                  to speak, "it's the other boarders. They've heard 
about you going back to the factory, and to-night they all came to me 
and
                  said that they would not live in the same house as a 
'scab,' and that if you did not go to-night they would all leave in the
                  morning; and so you see, sir, I could do nothing else 
except to ask you, although I am sorry to lose you, if ——"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"To-night!" he said, bitterly, "they 
are in a hurry—to-night!"</p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 142] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">"If you please, sir, that's what they 
said, and if you can make it convenient to go, sir—there is that little 
matter of arrears,
                  we would call that square."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Very well," he said, turning on his 
heel abruptly, "I will think over it."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"To-night!" he muttered, as he lit the 
candle in his own room; "to-night! Ah well, as well to-night as 
to-morrow, or the next
                  day."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">In the morning a small crowd gathered 
in the street.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Poor fellow!" said a woebegone woman 
who was nursing a wan and woebegone infant; "poor fellow!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"<i>You</i> pity him!" exclaimed a man 
at her side; "only for him we should have won. As it is—look at me, look
 at yourself, look at
                  the child, half-starved now, and likely to be 
whole-starved soon, thanks to <i>him</i>—and you <i>pity</i> him!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">And one by one the crowd took the 
question up, and discussed it; for by this time the news was generally 
known.</p>

               "Omicron"
               
               <p class="noindent">THE wind whistled, and every now and 
then threw a splash of sleety rain against the fissured face of a 
bleached, grey rock.
                  A cavity in its centre looked to the south-west, 
whence wind and rain came; and although the hole extended a good way, 
the
                  chill gusts occasionally reached the farthest corner. 
Gyp Pringle crawled back as far as possible and built up a barricade
                  of coarse packing-paper which he had carried on his 
back from Sydney ware-houses.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Dog-weariness made him sleep. He had 
tramped town and suburbs all day in search of work—the gate to bread and
 beef and, mayhap,
                  ale. As he closed his eyes the rattle of reed and 
brass music was borne across the Domain from the precincts of Government
                  House.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Soon he dreamed. What a heaven of 
gratifications spread before him! Beef, potatoes, ale, whisky, tobacco. 
He stretched out
                  a hungry hand. Alas! he awoke.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Realising the cruel hoax, he kicked 
viciously. To his surprise his foot struck something soft, a composite 
of flesh and blood,
                  and a plaintive whine made humble protest.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Now, then," said Gyp, "who the devil 
are you? This hole's mine. No doubt you're a Socialist. Well, clear out!
 I didn't slope
                  roun' town an' hump this here swag o' old paper an'

               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">This time the whine became a subdued 
bark, and a cold nose was thrust into his hollow hand.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Me bloomin' 'ead! ye're a dawg! An' I

               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He kicked.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Sometimes though, notwithstanding me 
logic, I've thought that if those on top were a bit kinder to the folk

 me heart."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He kicked again.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"If, when a coal-heaver snooked into 
Governor 'Ampden's, 'Ampden gave 'im time to draw breath before firin'

               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He drew up his foot smartly.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Well, now," he said, sitting up, 
"dammut, but I'll give me heart her way for onst. Let her go, 
Gallagher!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">When daylight came Gyp examined his 
partner in adversity, and recognised that the dog belonged to a lady in 
whose garden he
                  had done a couple of days' work a week or two before. 
This he considered an extremely gratifying discovery.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Me bloomin' 'ead!" he exclaimed; "this
 means a big reward, if it doesn't lead to a constant job, with a 
liberal pension for
                  me old age!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Laying hold of a piece of rope and 
looping it round the famished creature's neck, he continued:</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"It's a pound if it's a thankee. No 
doubt the dawg's been lost for a time, for his hair's peelin' off. He's

 o' me for the future. 'Do a kind hact' will be my motter. I venture to 
say most people with that motter found a dawg to

to reap the reward o' virtue! Yer mistress'll be that glad to see yer

               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What have you to say?" asked the 
spectacled magistrate.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"That dawg came to me under a rock in

 obtained work in this lady's garden with the clear intention of making

since. Then you induce the dog off and keep him in your low haunts until
                  a reward is offered. Sydney is cursed with loafers of

               <p class="noindent">AN IDYLL OF LITTLE BOURKE-STREET.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">WHEN Aggie had persuaded Chuck Maroney 
to marry her, she did up her hair. "I ain't takin' no risks," she 
explained; and at
                  the critical moment she said she was twenty-one in so 
artless a manner that even the shabby, red-nosed parson, who had been
                  passed by thirty-two congregations to land at Smith's 
Matrimonial Agency, held for a moment the sincere thought that she 
looked
                  very young. At the time for fitting on the ring Chuck 
indignantly scorned the aluminium circlet proffered by the 
Agency—"Weddings,
                  with duly qualified clergyman and ring provided, 10s. 
6d."—as the advertisement ran. "Ef this here's gointer be done at all,
                  it's gointer be done in style," he said proudly; and 
he ostentatiously drew from his waistcoat-pocket another ring—gold this
                  time, and of strength and weight sufficient to 
restrain a horse.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Chuck was impressive in his bearing as 
he carefully fitted the ring on the girl's finger; and it was with the 
manner of one
                  treading on air that he asked the clergyman across the
 road after the ceremony, "ter join me and the missus in a long-'un."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">On the tram, going home, the bride 
proudly kept her fat brown fist clenched on her knee with the heavy gold
 band uppermost—shining
                  out and proclaiming to all the world that she had 
fulfilled her destiny.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Chuck didn't trouble to go to Ginger 
Macauley's for a barrow of fruit that day. "We done our honeymoon six 
months ago," said
                  Aggie when he suggested the formality; but he 
maintained that something of the sort was necessary for the sake of 
appearances.
                  So Mr. and Mrs. Maroney compromised on an afternoon's 
trip to<span class="pb"> [PAGE 147] </span>Beaumaris—"the round trip 2s.
 6d." (as extensively advertised by the Victorian Railway Department) 
being seized upon as the
                  most economical form of honeymoon extant.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The sands of Sandringham, the long, 
meandering avenue of dark green ti-trees enclosing the tram-line, the 
brown cliffs of
                  Beaumaris themselves—looking like a bit of Sydney 
Harbour lifted up and set down in the midst of the wastes of Port 
Phillip
                  bay—all seemed invested with beauty more intense than 
ever; and away between the brown and green tints of the land the sea
                  lay beneath the sun smooth and pale-blue, with a bloom
 on it like a ripening plum. It was at Beaumaris that they had their
                  wedding breakfast; and it was in the soft, mossy 
groves along the cliffs that they told their love over again and forgot 
that
                  such a place as Little Bourke-street ever existed, or 
that the curse of working for a living had ever fallen on mankind.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Below on the sand they took off their 
boots and stockings and paddled like children, and with the combined 
influences of love
                  and happiness and sea-air became so hysterically 
intoxicated that Aggie "chucked-off" in a particularly nasty way at the 
porter
                  at Cheltenham, and a stand-up fight between him and 
Chuck was narrowly averted in consequence.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">At the city, it was oysters and stout 
at Billy the Greek's, a fruit-supper next door, and a bottle of wine at 
Francesco's;
                  and it was close on midnight when Chuck and Aggie 
turned from Little Bourke-street into Hogan's-place—the one spot in all
                  Melbourne that resembles the "courts" so common in the
 big English towns. There was a crowd in front of Levy's door, and there
                  were loud voices there, rising from the circle of 
black, flat figures that dodged around the lights in Levy's cart.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Pull out, pull out!" whispered Aggie; 
"it's on'y the ole push. Slip in without 'em seein' yer."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">But the old push—always eager to 
impress on everybody that it "knew somethin' "—stood to its self-given 
reputation in this
                  instance; and the attempt of the newly-married couple 
to avoid the meeting was seen.
               </p>

"there's a beer waiting for yer here, an' we was just goin' ter drink 
the health av
                  you and the missus."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The man paused, irresolute; but at that
 moment there peeped from behind the cart the sleek black head and 
piercing eyes of
                  "the Zulu"—one of the girls at the Black Angel, and 
one whose company Chuck Maroney used much to affect before he met Aggie.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Aggie saw the dark, handsome face, and 
pressed her husband's elbow. "Come along," she whispered. But the 
whisper reached the
                  Zulu, and she stepped out. "Come along," she laughed; 
"we're an hones' woman now, ain't we? Our old pals ain't clars enough
                  for us. You poor silly little fool, you had to <i>make</i>
 Chuck Maroney marry you. He tried to make <i>me</i> marry him. Me!—me 
marry Chuck Maroney!" and in the dead silence of the square her pitiless
 laugh rang up hard from the stone
                  pitchers. "Poor silly little fool! you an' yer fine 
husban'! Why, he was mine afore ever he was yours; an', marriage an' 
all,
                  he's mine to-morrow if I say the word."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">A bottle flashed up, and the blood fled
 from Aggie's face, leaving it white and horrifying. "Knock off!" she 
yelled; "or I'll
                  shot this in yer mouth."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Chuck seized the weapon from his wife, 
and as the Zulu saw his hand close upon it she leaped forward, and her 
white fist swept
                  grazingly across Aggie's face. Though ill-aimed, the 
blow was heavy, and Aggie staggered back to recover herself against the
                  wall. There her face fell within the focus of Levy's 
lamp, and the change was plain. The jolly, reckless look she usually
                  wore, the grey rage that the words of the Zulu had 
called up, had both disappeared. Instead was a calm, determined 
expression,
                  almost masculine, and as she stepped out again, with 
the right arm square across her waist and her left elbow flapping at
                  her side, the Zulu quailed. Aggie was no longer the 
easy-going little larrikiness of week-days; no longer the infuriated,
                  insulted wife. She was a fighter pure and simple.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Unversed in the art of conflict, the 
barmaid ran wildly forward with her head down, spitting in her temper, 
and lashing out
                  blindly<span class="pb"> [PAGE 149] </span>with both 
hands. Aggie knew her opportunity. She stepped aside, swung the whole 
weight of her body into her left hand, and
                  the Zulu rolled over on the stones. From chin to cheek
 ran a deep red line that grew deeper as they watched; and Aggie, 
laughing
                  in her triumph, glanced from the face of her adversary
 to her left hand. Then raising it high above her head, she threw it
                  suddenly downwards, and as the few red drops fell to 
the pitchers, she nestled to her husband's side, and, holding up her
                  hand, smeared with blood across the four knuckles, 
said softly, "It was the ring that done it, Chuck; aincher glad yer 
married
                  me <i>now?</i>"

               "Frank Renar"
               
               <p class="noindent">WHEN an English King knighted the Sir
 Loin of British Beef he was probably ignorant of the august precedent 
of a Roman ruler,
                  who intended to raise a British oyster to consular 
rank, but, on reflection, decided that the honour was an inadequate one.
                  To enjoy a plate of oysters is a proof of culture; to 
enjoy a barrel, a proof of complete culture. But of late there had been
                  rumours of chemically-concocted imitations of the 
delightful bivalve. With the advent of the manufactured article, an 
awful
                  thing of slimy loathsomeness, surely good taste would 
pass away, and there be left no desire to train the palate for the 
mermaid
                  embrace of this delicate softness in armour. So I 
mused as, one by one, the Sydney Rocks were shrined in an appreciative 
grave.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Good Lord! Dolly!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The words shaped themselves in my 
throat, clattered up against the roof of my mouth, and almost found 
utterance. But the sight
                  of what came after drove them back to the limbo of 
things unspoken. It was certainly Dolly; Dolly looking even more rounded
                  and voluptuous than she had looked an odd dozen or so 
months before. But he that followed was as surely her husband, a husband
                  still under the glamour of a honeymoon preserved by 
passion or art beyond its decent and proper limit of thirty days. 
And—Great
                  Heavens! would the procession never end?—there came 
filing into the shop a third, a handmaiden of Venus Genetrix, bearing
                  in her arms the baby of Dolly, and the evident pride 
of Dolly's husband. Confounded, I watched the entrance of the 
nurse-girl,
                  half expecting, half fearing the doorway to be 
darkened by yet another.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Will the line stretch out to the crack
 of doom?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">A dreadful vision of a matronly Dolly, 
followed by scores of maids, each burdened by an infant that wagged a 
tiny finger of<span class="pb"> [PAGE 151] </span>reproach, oppressed me
 for a moment. Then I saw that the procession had ended. There was but 
one baby and one husband. Still,
                  the idea of Dolly with a husband and a baby ... and 
only eighteen months since. ... It was surprising, even alarming.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The husband seemed swelling with 
fatuous pride, resembling fantastically the Sydney Rock on my plate, 
which puffingly pushed
                  out its ample cream-coloured waist from a flat shell, 
as though the kindness of the Oyster Fates were favouring its destiny.
                  He was fair and beefy; and the proprietary air with 
which he viewed his wife and his baby was as obvious as his necktie. 
That,
                  a royal purple shot with brilliant green, wailed 
fearfully or shrieked exultantly as it caught the light obliquely or 
directly.
                  Dolly came to me with outstretched hand and a smile 
which showed two rows of white, even teeth, specked in three places with
                  gold. (The history of those specks I could have told 
with absolute devotion to detail. I cannot recall whether I still 
possess
                  the invoice.) There was not a suggestion of diffidence
 in her face. Her eyes did not plead: they boldly commanded.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"This, Dick" (Of course, his name was 
Dick. Men who look like that always are "Dick"!) "is Mr. Brice, an old 
friend of mine.
                  Mr. Brice—my husband, Mr. Moxman."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I felt confused, ashamed, afraid to 
take the hand of the honest fellow in front of me. But Dolly was 
imperturbable. I had
                  to accept the proffered hand and submit mine to its 
warm grasp; to refuse would have seemed strange, even suspicious to Mr.
                  Moxman. Though, on reflection, I could no more think 
of suspicion as possible in his mind than I could imagine a pearl under
                  the vest of the fine oyster, the last of its dozen, 
which still pushed out its stomach as a suggestion to mine,—losing, I
                  thought, a little of the first sleek look of content 
as I continued to delay the devouring of it.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">They stayed half-an-hour or so. Moxman 
told me, admiringly, how his wife doted on oysters—"not a common taste 
in women." It
                  seemed to him distinctly genteel. I was tempted to 
tell him in return how the oyster is the touchstone of character, by 
which
                  the shop-girl and the theatre-girl are judged; a taste
 for the bivalve<span class="pb"> [PAGE 152] </span>is significant of 
much. But why should I play the Serpent in a Fool's Paradise? The baby, 
of course, had to be admired, and
                  its striking resemblance to Dadda noted. When the maid
 brought the little germ of a sinner up for admiration, Moxman suggested
                  that perhaps "the girl" would like some prawns. Mrs. 
Moxman frowned the idea down.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">At last they went, he gloating over his
 wife with greedy eyes, the nurse-maid following with the defiant 
humility of an Australian
                  servant.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Now, at Deluigi's you get the finest 
oysters in all the city of Sydney; the only Tasmanian trumpeter that can
 make an Englishman
                  forget the turbot; and schnapper of sentimental 
plumpness. But I was forced to resolve upon an abandonment of this home 
of
                  salt delights. I could not risk meeting Dolly again. 
To sacrifice Deluigi's was to lose something of life. Yet, after all,
                  one must sooner or later pay for one's pleasures. 
After eighteen months the price of that rosy fortnight at Lake Macquarie
                  had to be paid.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Saddened by the thought of this 
sacrifice on the altar of a dead ecstasy, I thought bitterly of Dolly, 
her husband, and the
                  baby, going home. I could see her as she swam proudly 
by his side, and hear her as she asked him if he had noticed how 
confused
                  and red I had been. "Poor Mr. Brice! He was an old 
admirer of mine. For twelve months he teased me something dreadful to 
marry
                  him. He is not a bad-looking fellow,—though, of 
course, nothing like you, Dick." (This with an admiring look aloft). "He
 has,
                  too, no end of money; but, you know, Dick" (with a 
squeeze of the arm which she held) "I always had an ideal, and until I
                  met you—"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">When they reached home, I could imagine
 the hot and flustered nursemaid asking to be allowed to go out that 
night, and being
                  refused by the indignant little matron, who tells her 
how wrong it is for young women to go out unaccompanied, and hints 
darkly
                  as to what may happen to girls guilty of such wrong.

               "Brogden"
               
               <p class="noindent">IN the spring of '81, I was in 
Greymouth, M.L. For a young man just freed from the heat of North 
Queensland there was plenty
                  to see and to do. The town is inconsiderable, but 
there is a noble river for bathing and boating. The bush-clad hills and
                  narrow limestone caves are delightful; while to walk 
out along the mile-long breakwater, and watch the giant breakers rush
                  surging in, gives an experience not easily to be 
paralleled elsewhere.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">One day old Tainui, the Maori "odd man"
 at my hotel, started out for Point Elizabeth, a rocky headland some six
 miles up the
                  north coast, to try a new lobster-pot he had made out 
of green supplejacks. We crossed to Cobden, an obsolete township on
                  the north side of the Grey River, and here I foolishly
 gave old Tainui half-a-crown to get some rum. He got the rum and 
carried
                  it, walking just behind me; and, after half-an-hour or
 so, he calmly lay down by the roadside, handing over to me with Maori
                  gravity the empty rum bottle and the lobster-pot and 
bait.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Mentally cursing the old fellow, I 
pushed on. I had never been to Point Elizabeth, but it had been 
indicated to me from the
                  steamer's deck, so I knew I was right when, after a 
couple of hours' tramp, I arrived at a rocky island surmounted at one
                  end by a natural tower of rocks crowned with some 
tough bushes. The tide was just low enough for me to reach the fishing 
pools
                  on the island, and in a few minutes I had baited my 
trap, moored it securely in a nice deep pool, and was quietly sitting
                  down eating the lunch I had brought.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I had no lack of luck. Lobsters, or 
rather crayfish, were plentiful; and my first haul was three beauties. I
 had forgotten
                  to take the bag from old Tainui; but I tipped them 
into a securely<span class="pb"> [PAGE 154] </span>isolated pool in the 
table of rock from which I was fishing. Soon I had a couple of dozen 
crayfish in my extemporised aquarium,
                  fighting and tumbling over each other; and, growing 
tired of such easy sport, I started to explore the rest of the little
                  island.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Just then I discovered a curious thing.
 The pool I had my crayfish in was at the foot of a little wall of 
smooth rock some
                  twelve feet high. Extending to within an inch of this 
wall, and in such a position as to half cover the pool I was using,
                  was a huge flat piece of detached rock which, as I 
clambered upon it, I found to be just on the balance. It was, in fact,
                  a "rocking stone."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Here was a discovery. The mass was some
 ten or fifteen feet across; and, by shifting my weight some two or 
three feet on each
                  side of the centre, I found I could rock the stone to 
and fro in a novel kind of see-saw. The rocking-stone sloped sharply
                  down where it approached the little wall; and, going 
over to examine that side of it, my foot slipped from under me and I
                  came bang against the wall. The impact momentarily 
released the rocking-stone; my right foot slipped in between the stone
                  and the wall; and, as I took the weight of my body on 
my left, down came the stone again and I was a prisoner!
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I could not take my weight off the 
rocking-stone, for there was no crevice in the smooth wall above me to 
which I could cling.
                  I could not spring up to relieve the stone of my 
weight, for my right foot was jammed, and my left, being between it and 
the
                  wall, was rendered useless—even if the stone, instead 
of sloping sharply down, had been flat enough to get a footing for a
                  jump.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The pain, too, was intolerable. The 
space between the cliff and the stone was less than two inches, and I 
had the prospect
                  of being slowly drowned as the tide rose.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Execrating my luck, I considered 
possible means of escape. I had my knife, and if I could cut away my 
boot I thought surely
                  I could wrench my foot free. I got out the knife, and,
 after a lot of trouble, cut away my boot and sock. Then I got as good
                  a purchase as I could with my free foot, and tugged 
and wrenched<span class="pb"> [PAGE 155] </span>and tried to spring. No 
use; the harder I pressed with my free foot the greater the pressure on 
the rocking-stone and the
                  tighter the jamb.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">So I waited and waited. My foot was, of
 course, torn and bleeding, but so tightly compressed as to be almost 
without pain.
                  By-and-by the tide began to come in, and I found 
myself stupidly wondering how long it would be before it reached my 
mouth;
                  and whether Tainui would recover his senses and 
liberate me—or my remains. I pictured to myself my skeleton, and 
wondered
                  whether my head would fall off first, or if I would 
float off from where I was jammed.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then I fell into a kind of dozing 
stupor, and some hours must have passed, for presently I woke to find 
the spray dashing
                  over my face. Then I discovered that feeling had come 
back to my foot. Slowly I grew conscious of a cutting, pinching 
sensation,
                  and, looking through the crevices, I saw—the crayfish 
were grappling and beginning to eat my toes!
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The agony of that time! I yelled 
idiotically at the brutes, forgetting they could not hear. I tried to 
stamp with my free
                  foot, and then, the horror of the thing overcoming me,
 I cursed and yelled like a maniac.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Suddenly, during a lull in the booming 
of the surf, the echo of my despairing coo-ee came back to me from the 
foothills. Fool
                  that I was not to have called out before, I thought; 
there might be someone within range. I had lungs like leather, and, 
quickened
                  by hope and maddened by the attacks of the lobsters, I
 sent out a succession of coo-ees that fairly lacerated the atmosphere.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Just as I was on the point of 
desisting, a figure appeared on the beach. I thought of Tainui, but no! 
the figure was a woman's,
                  and my heart sank as I reflected that she would be 
powerless to help. By this time the spray from the breakers was flying
                  over my head incessantly. No sooner, however, had the 
woman made out for certain that there was someone on the rock than she
                  set about<span class="pb"> [PAGE 156] </span>rescue. 
Quickly she discarded her short and scanty costume and entered the surf.
 Cleverly she breasted the rollers, taking
                  full advantage of the undertow and diving through the 
worst of the breakers, until she gained the rock and came stepping along
                  its slippery surface.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">As she neared me, I wondered. She was 
nearly full-grown, her body and limbs displaying the perfection of 
athletic womanly
                  grace. She could not be a Maori—or a half-caste, 
even—she was too light. And she surely was not a European, for she 
betrayed
                  no token of shame at standing thus nude before a man.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Quickly she learned my plight, and like
 a Trojan set herself to free me. She ran to the opposite end of the 
stone, and, though
                  the breakers were now beating on it, tried to bear it 
down so that my end would tilt up and release me. Her weight was not
                  enough, but as active mentally as she was physically, 
she sang out, "Hang out as well as you can while I go for a sapling."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Though every second seemed like a 
minute to me, the novelty of this turn in the adventure took my mind off
 the pain sufficiently
                  to let me admire the girl's strength and agility. 
Lord, how she swam! Sometimes I would see her on the curl of a breaker,
                  side-arming ahead like a steam-engine. Then, as the 
wave broke, I would catch sight of her head as she shook her long hair
                  back and gamely breasted the undertow. Soon she gained
 the shore and, wet and bare as she was, ran along the beach out of
                  my sight. When she reappeared she had in her hand a 
tomahawk, and made across the shingle bank into the scrub that bounds
                  the beach. She soon returned with a long, stout 
sapling.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">How she lugged this heavy green stick 
through the surf over to the island where I was; how she inserted the 
end in the crevice
                  alongside my foot and prized away that dreadful rock, 
must be imagined, for I cannot describe it. What I know is that she
                  got me ashore just after dark, and, my foot being 
fearfully injured (the crayfish took part of two of my toes—old Dr. 
Morrice
                  took the rest), she extemporised a pair of crutches 
and took me home to her father's hut.

 his history, which included, of course, that of his half-wild girl. His
 name was Tregarthen—a
                  Cornishman; had been a miner; was a beachcomber on the
 seventeen-mile beach. She had grown up what Mrs. Grundy would call
                  a regular heathen; till in her seventeenth year, 
though she could neither read, write, sew, nor dress herself decently, 
and
                  knew no more of religion or civilisation than a 
troglodyte, she could shoot, fell a tree, "wash" the black-sand, dig in 
the
                  garden, and swim like an otter.

               <p class="normal">I stayed at the house until the packer 
brought out a horse to carry me into town and to the hospital. And now 
... now my plain-spoken
                  friends tell me that it was all a scheme, that I went 
fishing for lobsters and caught something that holds a good deal tighter
                  even than a lobster—a wife. However, as the same 
friends rave about the beauty of my wife's face and figure, I am 
satisfied,
                  because I, who first saw her shining like a 
water-goddess on the rocks at Point Elizabeth, know that their praise is
 true.

               <p class="noindent">WHAT more pleasant than this 
river-solitude among the whispering red-gums, to swim or loiter or dream
 in, this serene Sunday
                  morning. 'Tis the only church I love, and I am a 
devout listener. My bright-eyed little friend, the woodpecker, shall 
preach
                  me a sermon, and a magpie shall sing me his doxology, 
and the infinite deep of blue sky shall be my Amen.

               <p class="normal">Here let me lie, then, with the roots 
of this big tree for my pillow, and marvel awhile at the delicate 
filigrane of bronze
                  and chrysolite leaves above me, laid upon the azure 
air like rare tracery upon some antique vase. The air is wine-like and
                  warm; and the endless beauty of life, and the mystery 
of its myriad forms, fill me with their wonder. O leaves, and wings,
                  and antenn�, and stones, bring me closer to your 
great, open secret of Joy and Life!
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Multitudes of ants visit me; the big, 
black, warlike reconnoitrers, and their red-nosed brethren out of yon 
tree, climb over
                  me; little emmets go a-foraging in the folds of my 
garments, and lady-birds come and walk over my hands and my book and fly
                  away again into the great unknown of poetry and blue 
air and forest whence they came. Moreover, a small carnation-coloured
                  spider of large ideas has undertaken to weave my head 
fast to a neighbouring sapling, and evidently considers me his by right
                  of treasure-trove. A thousand innocent insects take an
 interest in me, till I begin to think I am fallen, like Gulliver, upon
                  a new Land of Lilliput. And, truth to tell, this 
borderland of the Australian bush is fairyland enough, with its weird 
beauty
                  and peace, its forest music and silences, and 
wonderful colours, and multitudes of busy little creatures in earth and 
air
                  and waters.

 to forget their din and<span class="pb"> [PAGE 159] </span>smoke? A 
little town, however, stands not far away in the wheat-fields of the 
plain, to remind us of the presence of man,
                  but not near enough to destroy our day-dreams; you can
 see the pale blue roofs of galvanised iron nestling into yonder fringe
                  of red-gums in the soft haze, a mile or so southward. 
How homely and beautiful in the illusion of distance! Who could dream
                  of how many vulgar taverns and ribald gossips and 
police-court cases that peaceful-looking little hamlet can bring forth?
                  Nor shall I reveal aught. To-day, one would fain look 
at that life from its rosier side. Perchance this afternoon, or in the
                  twilight, a few figures will be seen in pairs emerging
 from the haze-veiled borders; black-clothed swains, and their 
sweethearts
                  in light summery muslins decked with pink Sunday bows;
 and they will go loitering and cosseting and kissing in the shadows
                  by the river, these rustic lovers, and think they are 
the first who have ever been so wicked and happy in the world. And long
                  may the simpletons abide in their belief!
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">And the great river flows by, winding 
among the gum-swamps and the high marigold and ochre banks of clay, on 
its way to the
                  sea. All things around it, forest and plains and sky, 
are rapt away in that great idyllic dream of Nature that they knew along
                  with the emu and the flute-bird, ages ago, before the 
white man had come to them across the Big Water.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Through these dreamy woods great flocks
 of cherubim-like cockatoos fly in radiant circles among the luminous 
finery of the
                  gum-tree tops, shining snow-white and yellow against 
the sky. Their sentinels have caught sight of me, and have shrilled the
                  warning that a stranger is within view, and now the 
others fill the air with shrieks of protestation, anger, and alarm. 
Hitherto
                  they had been silently tearing the bark off the dead 
timber, searching for the soft pink grubs, as silently as they had 
stripped
                  farmer Jackson's corn for him last harvest. Now the 
trees are echoing like mountain caves with their raucous voices, and the
                  forest becomes resonant as a bell. The magpies, too, 
take up the alarm, and a bevy of parsonic-looking crows, who have been
                  pecking the body of a dead sheep, join in the chorus.
               </p>

               <p class="normal">In the distant lagoons, a troop of 
snow-white cranes look up in affright from their microscopic toil among 
the white water-lilies,
                  and gather and stand, like a row of surpliced 
choristers, on an old log, and finally go flurrying away in alarm over 
the russet-flowered
                  sedge to hunt for frogs and fish in more secluded 
haunts. Gradually the cockatoos cease their screaming, and the gum-swamp
                  resumes its eternal quiet—broken only by the antique 
sounds which make the forest silence so strange and wonderful. <i>Tap!—Tap!</i>
 You hear the bill of the spotted woodpecker, and little chips and 
flecks of bark fall rustling down the trunk; in the depths
                  of echoing trees far away some bird is calling, 
calling; and from yonder branches comes the sweet, roguish fluting of a 
magpie;
                  and anon the twitterings of parrakeets and the wailing
 notes of the summer-birds are heard.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Afar off in the swamp you hear the 
tinkling of a bell, which betrays the presence of Bill Rafferty's 
bullock "Strawberry"—affectionately
                  addressed by his owner in forms of rhetoric unknown to
 Quintilian. Strawberry is at present out with the rest of the team
                  for a fortnight's holiday in the gum-swamp, and as he 
pokes his nose among the flags and rushes each movement is accompanied
                  by the wonderful fairy music of his bell. Unseen in 
the midst of the thickets, one might imagine that the tired and stolid
                  old waggon-bullock, which has been sworn at and 
flogged these last ten years over all the roads of Riverina, and plagued
 by
                  labour, dust, flies, and heat till his spirit is 
broken and fled for ever—one might imagine, I say, that this broken-down
                  old beast were some wood-faun pursued with forest 
music; some forest Ariel, with his invisible minstrelsy; or might it not

sapphire-and-crimson sprite that flitted by on the river like a flash? 
It was the little kingfisher,
                  first cousin to the Momus of the woods, the 
laughing-jackass. Here in the clay-bank is the kingfisher's little nest,
 and there
                  is the branch over the<span class="pb"> [PAGE 161] </span>stream
 where he sits in the shadow and sees the bright waters pass beneath him
 in the mid-day.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">And if you go round that next curve of 
the river some evening in the twilight, very silently, the brown crane 
that sits in
                  the red-gum over the water may invite you to share his
 choice supper of river mussels, served up upon yon mud bank, and you
                  may eat them out of their own dainty shells of 
mother-of-pearl, enamelled and polished in Nature's most marvellous 
workshop,
                  where the colours were learnt from the clouds and 
waters at day dawn. With royal prodigality, my lord the Brown Crane 
leaves
                  these jewelled and opaline dishes uncared-for after 
once using them, and they shall glitter and shine in every morning sun
                  till next Winter come with his floods to bury them in 
the muddy river-deeps again. But the Brown Crane cares not, and haunts
                  the river shallows still with majestic ease and 
dignity.

               <p class="normal">And, as if by contrast to his 
sedateness, Nature has created a certain little blue-black fantail, a 
sweet-voiced, dainty little
                  fairy which sings in the woods and around the 
settlers' huts till long after sundown. Its movements are all bows and 
flirtings
                  and pirouettes. Its whole life is one courtly minuet; 
it cannot be sedate or thoughtful a moment, but poses and flirts and
                  is for ever sprightly, timid, and gay like some 
roguish maid, or some elf out of the "Midsummer Night's Dream." I have a
 hundred
                  times desired to ask it for news of Cobweb and Mustard
 Seed, or of the Queen Titania, but have been called back from such
                  fantasy by a rude, hilarious shout over-head among the
 gum-trees.

               <p class="normal">It is the laughing-jackass—the goburra.
 A rare realist, is Jack, and plays havoc with the moods poetical and 
sentimental.
                  A worse Philistine than Aretino! Hard to believe that 
he and his mates are not laughing at <i>me.</i> The deuce! can they know
 of that old love-letter I kissed the other night as I was putting on my
 nightcap? Or of those belated
                  sapphics I tried to cobble to the moon—or of my 
despair at finding no rhyme for Boomanoomanah? Or do they know of more 
serious
                  things? Egad, I distrust these birds! Early of a 
morning, before the faint white of dawn appears<span class="pb"> [PAGE 
162] </span>in the sky over the eastern swamps, the river-banks resound 
with their mad laughter. "Some people calls 'im the 'larfin'-jackass,'
                  but I calls him the mornin'-watch," says my friend, 
Pete the fisherman, who has been a soldier in his time. "A reg'lar 
regimental
                  bugler he is, and it's my belief as that there cuss of
 a bird takes a mortal delight in rousin' the whole lot of other birds
                  out of their sleep,—just like my old woman, for the 
matter of that, out of sheer devilry." So the magpie is called to his
                  glees and matins, and the kingfisher pokes his head 
forth from his mud-hole in the bank of the stream and considers whether
                  it is yet time to go bee-hunting in the peppermints or
 fish-spearing in the lagoons. The water-rats are startled like 
criminals,
                  in their prowling round the fisherman's lobster traps.
 And by-and-by the sleepy wood-dove is awakened and flies into the great
                  new world of the new day.

               <p class="noindent">THE little albino barber was quite a 
show feature of that small Maoriland township. He was about thirty-nine,
 unmarried, and
                  without a solitary love-experience, when one morning a
 girl stepped into his saloon.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Can you trim my hair, barber?" she

               <p class="normal">He had all ready when she returned. 
Enveloping her in a pink wrapper, he let loose the coils of jet black 
hair, which, as
                  he lightly shook their strands apart, fell about his 
feet in a profusion of glossy ripples. With a smothered exclamation he
                  stood back for a moment, his pink expressionless eyes 
growing redder-rimmed, his placid features working with delight in the
                  spectacle before him—so unique, so utterly unexpected.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I want you to cut a good deal of it 
off," she said; "it is <i>so</i> heavy." And she sighed wearily.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The usually communicative barber did 
not reply. He brushed and combed the wonderful hair, fingering it as 
though it were of
                  spun glass; then began to clip.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You are to take off quite six inches,"
 she ordered.</p>
               
               <p class="normal"><i>Snick! snick!</i>—the frizzy black 
fragments piled into quite a little heap at the albino's feet, but still
 those raven tresses swept the floor.

               <p class="normal">"Thank you," she said, when he had 
lifted and re-coiled that abon crown; "I shall work with less sense of 
oppression now that
                  you have lightened my load,"—and, smiling, she paid 
her shilling and went out.

               <p class="normal">"Oh, yes! I simply cannot bear the 
weight; take off a good length; it's too much, such a mass of hair!" And
 she settled herself
                  in the big chair, her small face reflected in the 
mirror.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The albino saw not the face; his 
thoughts were all of that glorious hair—his heart's first love.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Small and few were the locks he 
severed; but for over an hour he brushed and smoothed, till the 
blue-black polish reflected
                  the movement of his broad, flat-nailed fingers, while 
the girl, dozing, noted not how time passed. Customers were clamouring
                  for entrance when, with a heavy sigh of regret, he 
drew away the wrapper.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I'm afraid I've kept you a long time, 
but you've taken away my headache," she said, gratefully.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"'Eadache! Do you 'ave 'em?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Almost all the time. I'll come again 
soon to have it charmed away."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I'ope yer will. I'm always free early 
afternoons. Yes, I 'ope yer will," repeated the albino; not looking at 
her, but speaking
                  to the hair.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She passed out into the street, and met
 her headache at the first step on the rude pavement.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The albino, on his knees, carefully 
gathered every hair from the sheet he had spread to receive them as they
 fell; and placed
                  the gleanings in a little screw of silver paper upon a
 shelf, among several similar parcels.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">After a month the weather set in cold, 
bringing sleet and snow. It was at half-past ten that the albino, having
 warmed his
                  small, limp frame with a pint of beer, turned out his 
gas and went to bed. He had scarcely got to sleep when a loud banging
                  at his street-door woke him with a start.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 165] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">As the banging continued he got out of 
bed, grumbling, and partially opened the door, enquiring, "'Oo's there?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Are you the barber?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"'Oo else d' y' s'pose?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Then you are to come with me sharp, 
and bring along the best case o' razors you've got."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"'Oo's wantin' me?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Oh, shut up, an' look alive! D'ye 
think I'm goin' to stand 'ere all night answerin' questions?" snarled 
the man, shivering.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You're none too bloomin' perlite 
yerself," snapped the albino, slamming the door in the face of the man, 
who retreated to
                  the waiting buggy, cursing the weather.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Presently the albino emerged, well 
wrapped up.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Ready?" asked the man.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Ready."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Not forgettin' the razors?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Not fergettin' th' razors." And 
neither spoke again until, after a long drive into the pitch-black, 
sodden country, they
                  drew up at a cottage.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The door was opened by a tall man.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Come in, my man," he said; and the 
albino entered, blinking at the light.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">It was a small room without a 
fireplace. Two silent, serious-faced men sat watching him.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Remove your wet things," said the tall
 man; and when the albino had complied, he continued, "Now, barber, are 
your razors
                  sharp?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yes'ir, sharp as razors," said the 
albino, his teeth chattering with cold.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"This is no time for jests," reproved 
the tall man; "I want you to shave a patient as soon as you are warm 
enough to keep
                  a steady hand—a very steady hand, mind."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The albino, with a low, whistling sigh,
 drew forth his case and examined its contents.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Whenever you are ready," hinted the 
tall man; and the three<span class="pb"> [PAGE 166] </span>preceded the 
albino into a larger room adjoining. The lamp was shaded, but a bright 
fire shed a flickering glow over a bed
                  upon which, moaning at intervals, but tossing, tossing
 ever, with incessant rolling of her pain-racked, fevered head, lay
                  the girl who had come to him in the summer, the 
possessor of—his hair.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"This is the patient. You can begin at 
once!" said the tall man, as the albino made no sign.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I couldn't do it, sir! Wot a 
sacrifice!" And all the blood in the albino's lukewarm body flew to his 
face and set his stiff
                  limbs tingling.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"It must be done," said the tall man, 
sternly.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The albino lifted a wisp of her hair, 
no longer glossy and soft; tangled, tarnished, harsh to the touch of his
 slow-moving
                  fingers.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">They attempted to hold her still, but 
no efforts could quiet her. Anguished at the sight of that black, 
dishevelled mass the
                  albino said:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"If I'd a brush I think I'd calm'er 
down."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">They handed him one, which he drew 
slowly and regularly from her forehead to the furthest point of hair he 
could reach. At
                  the end of an hour she lay still.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He clipped every lock, laying each to 
each as he relinquished them, until you could have supposed them severed
 at one cut.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The shaving was more difficult: the 
light was poor.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">But after two hours there remained a 
bald head with a little fringe of black round the face, where a narrow 
line of hair still
                  grew.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The albino gathered his tools, 
whispering, "I'spose I'd better take this'ere"—indicating the hair—"an' 
make it up: 'er mother
                  might like it?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yes, yes, just as you please," said 
the tall man.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Pore young thing," went on the albino,
 winding the hair into a neat coil.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"It's very sad," replied the tall man; 
"pupil teacher, teaching all day, studying all night, too much for 
mortal woman: the<span class="pb"> [PAGE 167] </span>result——" Looking 
towards the bed, as if struck by some thing he saw there, he stepped 
swiftly to the girl's side.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Barber, you have left a fringe of 
hair!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yes'ir, I thought they'd like it, 
in—in case of anythin 'appenin'—she'd not look so—so 'orrid like."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I understand." And the tall man bowed 
his head.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Two days later something did happen.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The albino wove the hair into a 
beautiful plait, secured at each end by a buckle cleverly made from its 
own strands.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">But her mother never got it.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">When he came to the end at last, after 
six weeks of loving toil, and was about to send it away, something 
snapped at his heart.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He tried to weep: not a tear. Then he 
rose and cast an enquiring eye upon the beams which braced his roof.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The middle one would do.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He got his step-ladder and placed it 
beneath the beam, then mounting, found the precious coil just long 
enough. As he finished
                  his preparations, a verse he had once seen quoted in a
 weekly paper came into his head:
               </p>
               
               <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

               <p class="normal">It had appealed to him as a barber, and
 now he understood it as a man. He repeated it softly as he stood.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Know no such liberty," he concluded, 
smiling to himself. Then he kicked away the ladder.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He looked very happy, they said when 
they found him—"for a hanged man."</p>

 A Love Story.</h4>
               J. J. Poynton
               
               <p class="noindent">JOCK CONDON was over forty as years 
count. He was grey in patches, and wrinkled and fat. His hands were 
swollen from hanging
                  listlessly, and bad weather had distorted his face. By
 proper reckoning he was getting old, but, measured by the standard
                  of experience, he was only a youth. And all because he
 was slow; other men had lived through their lives, had tasted of the
                  world, the flesh and the devil, had married and given 
in marriage, and had even made their final bow while Jock was travelling
                  to that point in existence whereat monumental marble 
ceases to be uninteresting.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">But, having reached that point, Jock 
began as a matter of course to court the young girls of the district, 
instead of the
                  mothers who had borne or the maiden aunts who had 
nursed them; and he met with ridicule. Even his experience with Maggie 
Johnston
                  only acted as a temporary check. He went on grinning 
upon one after another in his amorous fashion, putting the inevitable
                  question when chance offered, till there was not in 
the whole neighbourhood a single young woman unasked. Then Jock became
                  miserable. He sat before the fire in his lonely hut 
and thought, and thought; and it seemed to him that life was blacker 
than
                  the darkness that covered the earth. No mate was his, 
and years were going by. Fielding was dead, whom he remembered since
                  they were boys together. Morton was dead; and Joyce. 
He, too, would be called upon some day, the dream within his heart 
unrealised.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Suddenly his face brightened. He 
stirred the fire nervously and rubbed his hands. "Take the sheep round 
that way tomorrow,"
                  he muttered. And so the die was cast.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She was not an angel, this newest of 
Jock's chosen. Even he<span class="pb"> [PAGE 169] </span>guessed that. 
Her history no man knew; and as for her name—they called her 
"Strawberry." She came a stranger to that place,
                  but whence or how no tongue ever told. This only the 
Dogwood people knew: she had possessed herself of a hut and strip of
                  land in their midst; she wrought, and tilled, and 
delved as men do, and she lived somehow.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Now, Jock was vaguely conscious that 
Strawberry would not make an ideal wife, but he was desperate. So he 
bore up along the
                  bank of the creek next day, stooping to keep under 
cover, and made his attack. Strawberry was hooing a row of potatoes near
                  the fence. Jock could see the back of her head rising 
and falling with every stroke, and his heart thumped. He had often seen
                  her thus, and he wished now that he had introduced 
himself before—it would have made the task so much easier. However, he
                  crept up to the fence, and on hands and knees spent 
some time looking through a hole. Presently he stood up and whistled,
                  but bobbed down again immediately, with his heart 
thumping louder than ever. Strawberry worked on. A pebble was lying at 
his
                  hand. He picked it up and threw it over gently, so 
that it would not hurt. But the pebble fell short in the soft ground, 
and
                  the hoe came down with its rhythmic beat.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Jock got another stone, and, standing 
up, put his best effort into the aim. This time it hit Strawberry on the
 ankle just
                  where there was a big hole in her stocking, and she 
wheeled round in time to see a grinning face disappear behind the logs.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">That was enough for Strawberry. Hoe in 
hand, she rushed to answer the challenge. But Jock made off backwards, 
grinning and
                  showing all possible signs of peace. He wanted the 
lady to understand that this was merely his playful way of introducing
                  himself, but he stammered badly, and she was forcing 
matters.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You dashed gorilla!" she called out, 
climbing the fence; "I'll teach you!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">But just then Jock fell flat into the 
creek with a splash that startled the birds a hundred yards off. He 
struggled out on
                  the<span class="pb"> [PAGE 170] </span>other side 
dripping, with hat in hand, only to find his lady-love still brandishing
 the hoe.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Will yer marry me?" he called out 
across the water.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The hoe was gradually lowered.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Eh! what's that?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Jock put the question again, adding, 
"That's what I came for."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Well, why didn't you say so, you 
grinning idiot?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Jock looked pleased at the compliment.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Who the devil are you, anyway?" she 
went on.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He told her.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Well, come over here!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He waded through and stood meekly on 
the bank. Then they sat on the fence for awhile, and later on Jock 
helped to carry her
                  things to his hut.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">There was not much romance about it as 
the world judges, but poor old Jock was satisfied at the time. And even 
afterwards,
                  when Strawberry took command and upset all his 
household arrangements,—when she was spending his money freely on visits
 to
                  the township, and bullying him of nights,—he was very 
patient. Throughout long days, while following the sheep, he discussed
                  the matter with his dogs; but Rover showed plainly 
that he had no opinion whatever concerning marriage, and Laddie only 
wagged
                  his tail.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">At length, Jock came to regard his 
experience as natural, and this bred in him a kind of helpless pity for 
all married men.
                  He began secretly to long for his lost solitude, and 
his face grew sullen. Then, one night, after yarding the sheep, he found
                  a visitor at home A big, heavy-browed man it was, 
dark-looking as a Spaniard. He nodded carelessly as Jock entered, and 
took
                  no further notice, while Jock sidled into a corner to 
sulk. All the evening, the stranger talked familiarly with Strawberry.
                  They laughed and joked coarsely, and about ten o'clock
 the stranger turned abruptly to Jock: "About time you sloped, isn't
                  it?" he said.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 171] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">Jock stared like an owl.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"About time you got!" repeated the 
stranger.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Where to?" Jock asked, stupidly.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"To blazes—I don't care. Ain't room for
 three here, anyway."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Jock had come to that conclusion also, 
yet he was inclined to protest.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"But——" he commenced.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No 'buts,' " the visitor interrupted, 
standing before the fire; "there's a hut down by the creek. Come on, 
now—get! This
                  here's my missus."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Jock turned pale, and his eyes rolled.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Her?" he asked, jerking his thumb.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Strawberry went towards him and said, 
more softly than he had ever heard her speak before, "You'd better go. 
Take a blanket
                  and some tucker with you."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She made a bundle silently and opened 
the door, and when it closed again the shepherd realised that this had 
been his home
                  for over thirty years.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The man within laughed harshly. 
"Strange old bloke, that!" he remarked.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The woman did not answer for a while, 
then she said, "He's not a bad sort, Bob."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Next day Jock met the ration-cart near 
the main road. "You needn't go down to—to the hut to-day. I'll carry the
 stuff," he
                  said to the driver.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The bag was handed out. "How's the 
missus, Jock?" the young fellow asked with a grin.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"She—oh, she—the bag isn't heavy," Jock
 answered, as he hurried away.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">So Jock lived in the hut that used to 
be Strawberry's, and cooked his own meals again, and muttered, and 
stirred the fire
                  just as in years gone by. And when about a month had 
gone a swagman passed towards the setting sun, and Jock knew that 
Strawberry,
                  too, was alone.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 172] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">Then began a struggle. Should he go 
back to her? Should he claim his own hut? The dogs did not know; and 
while he was still
                  pondering, and wearing himself to a skeleton, came a 
day when the sheep were not liberated. Another followed, and by noon
                  Strawberry took his place. She let the hungry animals 
out and sought the shepherd by the creek. He was sick—was very sick.
                  And she set to work to nurse him back to health. All 
day she watched his sheep, at night she yarded them, and came to sit
                  beside the bed; and, while he lay thus unconscious in 
summer heat, a fire broke out. At sundown it seemed far away, but the
                  north wind rose and urged it on, and by midnight the 
sky was red for miles, and the woman could hear the crackling grass and
                  leaves. She thought of the penned-up sheep, and, 
single-handed, burned a strip around the yard. Then, with set face, she 
hurried
                  back to the hut and stood on guard. And later, when 
the Dogwood people came, they saw against the broad front of the fire
                  the solitary figure of a woman fighting as never woman
 fought before. So she worked and watched till Jock got well again,
                  and together they went back to his hut. There she made
 a garden and planted fruit-trees; she helped him with the flock; she
                  saved money. They even enlarged the hut in the course 
of years; and when sickness came again it was Jock who bore the burden
                  of the toil and the watching; and he it was who was 
left to mourn.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He came home one day and found their 
visitor of years before waiting, his brows even more shaggy, his skin 
even darker.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Gone?" the fellow asked laconically, 
pointing to the closed door.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Dead!" Jock answered simply.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The stranger started. "No! ... She was 
my wife," he said quickly.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"The grave-stone says Missus J. 
Condon," was the response; and there was a touch of pride in the old 
man's voice.</p>

 Patient's Hand-Bell.</h4>
               F. M. W. G.
               
               <p class="noindent">DR. LAWTON sat down to his dinner in a
 distinctly irritable frame of mind. He had only just come to —— 
Hospital as house-surgeon;
                  and, in the midst of the hundred and one worries of 
settling down, he had by no means appreciated finishing a long day's 
work
                  by having to dance attendance on a particularly fussy 
"honorary" as the latter made his rounds. Now he expended some of his
                  accumulated vexation in a vicious thump on the knob of
 the hand-bell which stood within reach of his right hand. Unfortunately
                  he did not derive the relief he expected, for the 
thing refused to ring, an additional grievance which resulted in the use
                  of vigorous expletives. Luckily these were cut short 
by the entrance of the ward-maid bringing his dinner, and the meal began
                  to work its due effect on the hungry animal.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Before long the house-surgeon had 
sufficiently recovered to take his usual amicable view of the world at 
large, and when the
                  bell which had so firmly resisted his efforts 
obligingly rang of its own accord, he only looked amusedly surprised. 
Taking
                  it up he examined it carefully. It was a slightly 
concave disc of brass on a stand; but he could neither move the knob at
                  the top, nor the hammer underneath.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">As he turned it slowly round a knock 
came to the door, and the matron entered.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"This is a nice useful sort of bell 
you've given me, Mrs. Boyce; you evidently don't mean me to become a 
nuisance by ringing
                  it too often."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The house-surgeon, in that beneficence 
of mood produced by the happy combination of a good dinner and an 
excellent digestion,
                  spoke quite genially, and he was utterly surprised at 
the effect of<span class="pb"> [PAGE 174] </span>his speech. The matron,
 a pleasant-looking, middle-aged woman, turned a chalky-white; then she 
flashed a glance at the ward-maid,
                  who, with a frightened look on her face, was clearing 
the table, her trembling fingers jingling the glasses and china.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">There was a little pause. Then the 
matron spoke quietly, but rather hoarsely.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Did you find it hard to ring, doctor? 
All you have to do is to press the centre of the knob firmly. It is 
rather stiff,"—and
                  she showed a small hollow in the knob.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"It's rather a complicated dodge for 
such a simple thing," was the doctor's comment; "only don't blame me if 
you have the
                  trouble of coming for nothing; it seems to have a 
little way of ringing all by itself,"—and Dr. Lawton put the bell on the
                  mantelpiece as he prepared to follow the matron out of
 the room.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Amongst the private hobbies which Dr. 
Lawton rode with enthusiasm was the study of hypnotism. He possessed a 
certain degree
                  of clairvoyance, and that and kindred subjects were of
 the keenest interest to him. His position at the hospital, while 
affording
                  him ample experience, gave him plenty of time to 
pursue such studies.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">One evening, a month or so after coming
 to the hospital, he was sprawling comfortably on his big, 
leather-covered sofa, enjoying
                  a final pipe before turning in. He was ruminating in a
 lazy sort of way on various phases of his favourite subject; an extreme
                  quietude pervaded the room, broken only by the 
striking of his erratic handbell. He was used by this time to its 
vagaries,
                  which he put down to the fickleness of feminine 
gimcracks; and now, as it disturbed the silence, it only served to 
recall,
                  in his semi-comatose condition, the fact that everyone
 connected with the hospital, whether matron, nurses, ward-maids, or
                  porter, was obviously and undeniably scared at its 
ring. And ...
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The heavy smell of sleep hung over the 
long hospital ward, saturated though it was with the odours of iodoform 
and carbolic
                  acid. The rows of beds veiled in mosquito nets, ranged
 against<span class="pb"> [PAGE 175] </span>each wall, looked like 
ghostly catafalques, shrouding unreal forms made grotesque in the dim 
light by reason of the cradles
                  and other surgical appliances. The figure of the night
 nurse, as she moved with soft deliberation from bed to bed, cast quaint
                  shadows on the spotless floor. Now and then a patient 
moaned, hardly disturbing the quietude of the ward, and occasionally
                  the tinkle of a bell called the nurse's attention. 
Nearly always this sound came from the bed at the farther end of a ward,
                  and again and again the nurse went to the bed, shook 
up the pillows, smoothed the covering, and tried to soothe the querulous
                  complaints of her patient.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She had done this for perhaps the 
twentieth time, when the matron appeared at the entrance to the ward. 
For a moment or two
                  they stood in conversation. Presently the matron 
walked down the room, stopping to take some small object from the long 
table.
                  Then she passed on to the bed where the wakeful 
patient lay feebly tinkling his bell. She, too, tried to soothe his 
restless
                  complaints; but, seeing he was not in a condition to 
be reasoned with, she put the bell she carried in place of the one 
beside
                  him, and turned away.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">For a little while the man lay still, 
his emaciated features working with discontent. Presently, with a huge 
effort, making
                  every joint in the bedstead creak and rattle, he 
rolled round, panting with the exertion, starting the perspiration in 
large
                  drops on his forehead. With a gesture of peevish 
determination he stretched out his hand for the bell. Half puzzled, half
                  annoyed, he was quick to detect the change. Instead of
 the handle which he had only to lift and shake, his hand covered an
                  unfamiliar brass disc. An angry glitter came into the 
glassy eye as he half lifted, half dragged the bell from the locker
                  to the bed. Resting for a few minutes after the 
exertion, he felt the bell all over with his long, thin fingers, unable 
to
                  sound it. A purple flush came into his face as he 
raised himself up to examine it in the dim light, then, with a gurgling
                  gasp, he fell back on his pillows. His jaws gaped, the
 bell dropped from his nerveless hand and rolled upon the floor, and
                  the feeble, flickering life went out ...
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 176] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">It seemed to the house-surgeon that he 
was not more awake now, lying on his comfortable sofa, than he had been a
 few minutes
                  before, when he so clearly saw the struggles of the 
dying man to ring his hand-bell.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">There it stood on the table near him. 
Just then the hammer struck against the brass disc. The matron, entering
 the room, heard
                  it, the usual scared look coming into her face at its 
sound. She had come to ask for a prescription the doctor had promised
                  her, but she had hard work to steady her voice to make
 the request. Dr. Lawton went to the writing-table and wrote for a 
minute.
                  Rising, he crossed to the matron, and spoke:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Mrs. Boyce, can you tell me how this 
dent was made in the side of my bell?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He was a resolute man, and, as he 
spoke, his voice sounded harshly, almost intimidatingly, in the woman's 
ear. She made no
                  answer, and for a moment he stood looking compellingly
 into her eyes.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"It was given," he went on, "to a 
patient in No. 3 ward, and in his death-struggle it rolled on the 
floor."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">A long, gasping shudder ran through the
 woman's frame. She threw up her hands as if to shield herself.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Sir," she said brokenly, "it was not 
our fault; we did not know. We had no idea he was so ill; the doctors 
even did not think
                  he was in danger. It was hard to ring, and we often 
gave it to troublesome patients. They were just as pleased as long as
                  they had a bell of some sort, and he was an extra 
troublesome one—just the wreck of a man, brought in to end his days in 
the
                  hospital. He seemed likely to linger on for weeks; 
failure of the heart's action, the doctor said it was; but as there is
                  a God above I hope and pray that worrying over that 
bell did not hasten the end. Sir, it has driven us almost demented. Put
                  it where we would it rang, till it frightened the 
senses out of the patients and nurses. When you asked for a bell, I 
thought
                  surely <i>you</i> had done no harm, and here it might 
be quiet,"—and the woman broke down, sobbing like one at last relieved 
of a burden too
                  heavy to be borne.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 177] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">The next day, a typical Sydney summer 
day, a half-decked sailing boat was scudding down the harbour. In it 
were two persons,
                  Dr. Lawton and the man who owned the boat. There was a
 fairly calm sea, and they turned between the Heads, and out into the
                  ocean. There Dr. Lawton took a small and heavy packet 
from his coat pocket, and, going forward, quietly dropped it over the
                  bows. Had he been asked, he would hardly have cared to
 state his reason; still less could he account for his very genuine
                  feeling of relief as they put about.

               <p class="normal">NOT being used to letter-writing, I do 
not know how I ought to begin this. Ought I to call you Miss or Bess? 
One is too high-faluting,
                  and the other is too familiar-like for me, and we have
 not seen each other for a good while, although we began to go to work
                  at the same time. Why, now, how long is it since you 
used to do my sums for me when I could not manage my home-lessons? I
                  mind my old father saying that a letter should always 
be like a bill, the items put down all spick and span, and nothing in
                  it that is not needed any more than a real business 
bill would have; but the truth of the matter is I don't know how to say
                  what I want to say, but I suppose there's nothing for 
it but to put my hand to the helm and steer straight to the point I
                  want to reach. I'm one of those chaps who never get 
wild over anything one way or the other. They say that's what makes such
                  a good skipper of me. I can always see what is the 
right thing to do in any sort of weather. I am not saying this to blow
                  my own trumpet, because it comes to me to do the right
 thing. It isn't my fault. The ketch is my own, and it did not take
                  all of my savings to build her either, the beauty. 
These are the items. The total is—will you have me for a husband? There,
                  I have got it out at last. You could live in one of 
the river towns. The thing is you might be lonely while I am away on the
                  Bess. Yes, that's what I've called her I can't alter 
the name now, whatever your answer is, because everybody knows her by
                  it. I must not persuade, because if you remember me 
well enough to like me you will come anyhow, and if<span class="pb"> 
[PAGE 179] </span>you do not I hope you will not come just to please me.
 I do not suppose that you will decide all of a sudden, so I will call
                  at the address written on a slip of paper with this in
 a month's time. God (if He is the chap who looks after things)—God
                  bless you.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Yours, if you like the ownership,</p>
               
               <p class="normal">JOHN BAXTON.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">P.S.—The ketch is painted green with 
trimmings of white. I asked an artist chap what colours to have. I 
remembered that you
                  did not like a red hat and green jacket that sat 
opposite to us once on the ferry-boat. I had my own cabin-door in red, 
because
                  it is the colour of colours for me. It's the colour of
 the gums in the spring.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">P.S.—Another item I forgot, a bit of 
land on the river. The trees are all left. Once you said that houses 
ought to grow like
                  the trees do. Well, mine has been growing for a good 
many years in a very small allotment. I hope you won't think in my own
                  head, but, by Jove, perhaps you are tired of reading 
this by now and having a good laugh at me. I can't help that. I never
                  could help laughing at funny things myself.
               </p>

               <p class="normal">II.—THE LETTER SHE SENT.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Dear Mr. Baxton,—</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I have never had so hard a task as this
 of answering your letter. You have honoured me by asking me to marry 
you. You take
                  a great deal on trust, because you have only memories 
of me as a child. I have no particular memories of you; in fact, have
                  never thought of you at all. Do not think this is hard
 or unkind, but I am sure from the manly tone of your letter that you
                  would rather have the truth than anything else. You 
remember things I thought and said, and I only remember you as a 
rough-haired
                  boy who was<span class="pb"> [PAGE 180] </span>fond of
 laughing. Thanking you and apologising for anything that may seem hard 
in my letter,
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I am, yours very sincerely,</p>
               
               <p class="normal">BESS BURNS.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">III.—THE LETTER DIDN'T SEND.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">My Dearest Old Skipper,—</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Your dear letter came like a breath 
from the sea that you love so well. I remembered very little about John 
Baxton, but I
                  know the skipper who wrote my letter. Where it is at 
the present moment I am not going to tell you. But I will tell you that
                  I know it off by heart and say it for my grace while 
the children are pattering their "We thank Thee, O Lord." Not that I
                  do not thank Him too. I have so much to thank Him for 
since the fifth of a very wintry month, this year, but my heart is 
beating
                  thanks all the time. You said, "If He is the chap that
 looks after things," as though you doubted His existence. Why, my 
would-be
                  sceptic, who do you think makes people so glad 
sometimes, if everything is left to chance? But I do not care what you 
say
                  about it, because I know that, if anyone were in 
trouble, they would not hesitate to go to Skipper Baxton.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Your wife? I have only one objection. 
You would get to know me so well that you would not go to your 
imagination for my good
                  qualities any more, and I should not go to the same 
source for my romantic visions of you, either. I should dearly like to
                  sail with you in the Bess some of the time. Fancy the 
wife of a skipper who does not know what it feels like to be on the
                  ocean! Once I was in a sailing-boat, in the harbour, 
down past Bradley's Head, and we nearly capsized, but it is one of the
                  most splendid recollections I have in my poor brain 
that will only hold needles, scissors, and paper patterns. The wind sang
                  in the rigging, the sails cried out at the strain, and
 the waves leapt up and tossed the spray in our faces until the boys
                  were compelled to furl the sail and put up the 
spinnaker instead. And when we were safely round the head and<span 
class="pb"> [PAGE 181] </span>in Middle Harbour I felt as though I had 
had a glimpse of an awful but wondrous life. There, that is all I know 
of the sea
                  as far as being on it goes. The ferry-boats don't 
count, because they are very tame compared with the sailer. I have never
                  been since. Mother was so frightened that she made me 
promise not to go any more.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">That much was written on Sunday in 
church. Now I am waiting for a customer to come and have her dress 
fitted. It is four o'clock,
                  Saturday afternoon. I am very glad that we makers 
haven't to marry women, because the wives would have to make their 
husbands'
                  dresses. You don't think I am going to mend your 
clothes, do you? Because I am going to drown all needles in the Pacific,
                  and then spend all my days on the bit of land. A 
house? No, you needn't think of a house. When a house is built, a broom 
finds
                  its way into the kitchen, and when a woman has hands 
the broom finds its way into them and they sweep. There's a knock. My
                  customer. I must finish my dissertation on sweeping 
another time.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">If you will promise to keep an 
automatic machine for sweeping I will not finish my article on the 
matter, because the rain
                  during the last few days has reminded me that it would
 not be very pleasant camping in the grounds without a house. I am 
afraid
                  the flannel-flowers could not hold enough water to 
keep us dry.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">What was it you said about a red hat 
and a green jacket? Have I been a fashionable dressmaker all these years
 for nothing?
                  Don't you know that green and purple, and green and 
red, and green and blue and everything, are fashionable and artistic!
                  When you see me you will know me by the variety of 
colours I wear. Green hat, blue dress, scarlet necktie. violet sash 
spotted
                  with pink daisies, and blue roses in my belt. Do you 
know about the blue roses? Perhaps you have not read "The Light that
                  Failed." One chapter begins "Roses red and roses white
 sought I for my love's delight. She would none of all my roses, bade
                  me gather her blue posies Half the world I wandered 
through, seeking where such flowers grew. Half the world unto my quest
                  answered but with<span class="pb"> [PAGE 182] </span>laugh
 and jest. Oh, 't was but an idle quest. Roses red and white are best." 
But I am not a visionary, as this might lead
                  you to think; and I can mend torn clothes. So you 
needn't wonder if all my nonsense is nonsense, or if it is real, 
because—well,
                  what do you think it is? I do <i>not</i> like brooms.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Would you, could you, bring your ketch 
into the harbour at a given time?—and I would be at South Head (in all 
my colours)
                  to welcome her and—her skipper. I wonder what you are 
like. This is my impression from your occupation: short, thick-set and
                  sturdy when off duty, but nimble as a rabbit when a 
Sou'-Easter blows you towards the rocks and you want to give them a wide
                  berth. You are to admire my sailor-like talk because I
 have been reading Clark Russell and the <i>Boys' Own</i> to collect 
some nautical terms. Please answer these questions in your next letter, 
which is to come on the wings of the wind,
                  not by the postman, though he is forgiven for all his 
old tricks now, since—but never mind the date. Question 1. The gunwale
                  is the piece of wood that goes out from the back of 
the boat in a slanting direction, is it not? Question 2. Is the bumpkin
                  the little fence round the boat to keep the skipper 
from falling out? And, Question 3. I know the stays are the bulk of the
                  boat, the part under the water, so you needn't answer 
that question. If these are mistakes you are to understand that they
                  are intended for jokes, but if they are right they are
 not intended that way. Ask me questions about the different parts of
                  a boat, because I asked a man who knows all about it, 
yet there was a strange twinkle in his eyes when he told me some of
                  the things. I wonder if he was amusing himself. But 
you will tell me There is only one thing better than writing to you, and
                  that is seeing you. Am I always to wait for the 
contrary winds to move along? Can't they be regulated? Ah, it seems so 
wonderful
                  to me how you sailors can manage to bring the vessels 
safe and sound into port when contrary winds spring up. I would never
                  do for a skipper. I can't fight contrary forces. I 
turn back and go with the wind. I have only seen the vessels at anchor
                  in the harbour, and one gets so accustomed to seeing 
them stolid and still that it is hard to imagine them alive and full
                  of effort. I<span class="pb"> [PAGE 183] </span>wonder,
 when you are away on the Pacific and the winds spring up, if I shall be
 frightened? I don't think so. I shall be sure
                  that the wind never blew and the sea never roared that
 you could not conquer—and, after all, you are not going to see this.
                  I am just scribbling a fancy letter for recreation.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Good-bye, from</p>

               <p class="normal">In one of her rare lapses into 
carelessness the Little Dressmaker must have placed this scribbling-book
 among some others
                  that were to be given to the Mother for putting into 
the cake-tins when the cakes were made. And as Mother was tearing the
                  leaves out to put in the tins her eye caught the word 
"Skipper," and she read the rest of the page, and, becoming deeply 
interested,
                  looked for the others and read them all. And when the 
cooking was finished, this little Mother sat down to the table with
                  paper and pen—a most unusual thing, because Bess 
always wrote her letters and addressed everything that went through the 
post.
                  But this letter was written by the Mother, addressed, 
and taken to the post-office, and nothing was said to anyone, 
and—anyway,
                  there was no more Correspondence.

Martyr of no Account.</h4>
               C. H. Souter
               
               <p class="noindent">THE sun looked down unwinkingly upon 
the rolling sand-dunes covered with a scrabbly undergrowth of mallee, 
ti-tree and lianas.
                  It looked searchingly and pitilessly down upon the 
rubble hut with its flat tin-roof and "hessian" substitutes for windows.
                  The everlastings stiffened and curled in the fierce 
heat, and the earth sizzled and fumed. The sweat from the doctor's horse
                  quivered into the baked atmosphere and left streaks of
 acrid salt ruled down his heaving sides. No bird called. No insect
                  hummed. The flies were clinging to the shady sides of 
the limestone boulders, and Sheol was in the air.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Inside the hotel all was as dark as a 
cellar, and as close. There was the same stillness, save for the heavy 
breathing of
                  the man and the woman and the children—all lying in 
one bed smitten by the influenza-devil. The atmosphere of the place was
                  poison—fetid, stagnant, and charged with every foul 
human product. Only one person besides the doctor moved in the den, 
slowly
                  and with a mechanical languor. She was a girl of 
nineteen or twenty, who might have been good to look upon but for 
neglect
                  and uncleanliness and the advance signals of disease. 
Now and then the man ground his teeth and groaned voicelessly. The woman
                  whined an occasional answer to a question from the 
doctor. And the children slept the sleep of ptomaines and carbonic acid
                  gas. The girl stood listlessly at the foot of the iron
 bed, supporting herself, with both lean, horny hands clutching its
                  rusty rail.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"How long have you been down?" asked 
the doctor of the woman.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"A week," she complained; "and he has 
been in bed four days; <i>them</i>" (indicating the children) "all took 
bad ten days ago."
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 185] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">The doctor said little, but took 
temperatures, ausoultated chests, and made entries in his note-book. It 
was a monotonous
                  proceeding, broken only when he went out for a 
pannikin of warm water from the galvanised tank to wash his thermometer.
 The
                  man had the headache; little else of importance. The 
woman had the cough: the cough that is like the rending of the soul from
                  the body; but, again, little else of importance. The 
children had the deadly, helpless, hopeless sleep, from which they only
                  awoke at intervals to moan and toss and complain and 
go to sleep again.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Just then the man roused himself to 
whimper for "something for this 'ere pain in my 'ead. It's driving me 
mad." The woman
                  would "never live through another night if I don't get
 relief from this corf." The children made no complaint. They slept
                  and breathed ptomaines and carbonic dioxide. And the 
girl said nothing, but gazed at the doctor with a hazy, half-intelligent
                  stare and gripped the iron bed-rail harder, while her 
breath came and went in quick, irregular gasps and her nostrils moved
                  like those of a winded hare.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Anyone to fetch out the medicine?" 
Perhaps a neighbour would if the doctor would ask. Brandy? Yes. A little
 chicken-broth?
                  Yes; Violet Pearl would make that.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Violet Pearl! go and git Jimmy a 
drink! Can't yer 'ear 'im movin'?" whined the woman in a grieved tone; 
and then: "The girl
                  is that stoopid and mazy-like, she ain't the leastest 
good to nobody. As if it wasn't bad enough to be nigh onto death without
                  'avin' to worrit for everything as is wanted!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">As the girl returned, stumbling over 
the uneven limestone floor, her father broke out: "For Gawd's sake, 
Violet Pearl, 'ow
                  much longer are you goin' to let this 'an'kerchief dry
 on my 'ead? W'ere's the vinegar and water? Wring it out agin, carn't
                  yer!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Sit down," said the doctor to her, a 
moment later; "let me have a look at <i>your</i> chest." Listlessly she 
unfastened the dowdy calico bodice and bared her thin neck and 
shoulders, breathing a little harder,
                  but not appearing much interested.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Hm!" said the doctor, as he moved the 
end of the stethoscope<span class="pb"> [PAGE 186] </span>here and 
there, and tapped with his finger-ends on her all too plainly visible 
ribs; and then, a little later, "Temperature
                  104°, pulse 120, left posterior base solid," he wrote 
in his note-book,—and to the girl he added, "You must go to bed, and
                  stop there! If you don't do so now, you'll <i>have</i>
 to to-morrow, and then you may not get out of it again."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">A chorus came from the man and woman, 
"Lord sakes! doctor, w'at <i>are</i> yer talkin' about? 'oo's to look 
arfter <i>us?</i> She's the only one as is fit to move; as for <i>me</i>"
 (the woman continued alone), "<i>I</i> couldn't get up and do nothink, 
not if—if—you was to pay me! an' I'm sure <i>he</i> couldn't do nothink 
if he was to get up." The man groaned, and said his head would come off 
if he were to move, and it was
                  all nonsense talking of Violet Pearl "laying up." She 
was "always fancying she had something the matter with her."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The doctor sighed, and explained again,
 and at last lost his temper. "You good-for-nothing brute!" he said, 
looking contemptuously
                  at the man. "What the devil does your headache matter 
compared with this girl's chances of dying in forty-eight hours if she
                  doesn't go to bed? She's fifty times worse than your 
wife here; and, as for you, you're in no danger at all!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then he was sorry he had lost his 
temper, because it was of no use. The man groaned and the woman whined, 
and the children
                  slept, and Violet Pearl smiled feebly and breathed a 
little faster, and said she could get along all right till Aunt Emma
                  came; Aunt Emma had promised to come the day after 
to-morrow. No one else would come, because they were frightened of 
"catching
                  it theirselves." And again the doctor sighed, and then
 swore silently and rode away to arrange with a neighbour to take 
medicine
                  to them.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Two days later he went again. The same 
baking heat; the same white, glaring light from the sand beating on the 
frowsy "hessian"
                  and "sujee" windows; and, inside, the same fetid and 
plague-stricken atmosphere, and a silence this time broken by a few 
large,
                  yellow-bodied droning flies that boomed and buzzed 
about the room.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The man was sitting up near the 
fireplace. The woman<span class="pb"> [PAGE 187] </span>whimpered in a 
corner, seated on a kerosene-box. The children slept on a "shake-down" 
of gunny-sacks in another corner. And
                  on the iron bed, covered by a coarse and dingy sheet, 
which fell into hollows and stood starkly out in horrible, unmistakeable
                  ridges, lay something that had been Violet Pearl.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She had "got along all right" until 
that morning. Then the poor, willing, helpful spirit had shaken itself 
free and left its
                  partner, and the man with the headache and the woman 
with a cough had unwillingly got up to attend to their wants themselves.

 Vedder's Gold.</h4>
               A. Conway
               
               <p class="noindent">OLD Nick Vedder trudged manfully down
 the cliff-track to Strahan, picking his steps as one who had travelled 
far and whose
                  pack was heavy.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Morris, seeing him in the distance, 
awoke from day dreams into a sudden interest. "Here comes old man Vedder
 again," he said
                  to a companion who sat in the doorway of the 
Cornucopia Hotel, gazing seaward. But the latter, after turning a pair 
of blood-shot
                  eyes in the direction of the new-comer, looked out 
again between the points of the bay and said nothing.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"If I could only track him down" —— 
began Morris.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Bah!" impatiently said the other, who 
was called Maori Jack, "it's always the same cry. Never a soft-headed 
old hatter can
                  come down from the ranges for tucker but you Strahan 
loafers must have it that his swag's full of nuggets. There's not an
                  ounce of gold in the whole coast, I tell you."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"But he must be on to a good patch 
somewhere," insisted Morris. "It was all a plant, him showing us those 
pyrites specimens
                  and pretending to believe they were the genuine. He's 
not the luny you think, I'll swear that. It's all a game to hide that
                  he's on good gold, and it's a game I'm going to take a
 hand in before long."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">But the other, with fine inconsequence,
 remarked that they'd have a bit of wind behind them this trip, and had 
better be going
                  before it died. That it would take them two hours good
 to get across the harbour, anyway, and old Yedolph had got to have
                  his keg that night whatever happened.—And for the 
traders in illicit spirits, old Yedolph, proprietor of the Cornucopia 
Hotel,
                  Strahan, was a person whose wishes were not lightly to
 be disregarded.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 189] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">Morris, dozing in the bottom of the 
boat, heard rough steps on the shingle, and, looking up, with the blink 
of the slanting
                  sun in his eyes, saw Maori Jack and Lang, called "the 
Butcher," running across the foreshore to where the boat lay beached.
                  On their heels followed Christian, one of the two 
local policemen; and the other was panting lamentably in the rear as he
                  jogged through the pig-face scrub. Morris pushed the 
boat clear of the beach, and stood waiting, ready to pole-off. Maori
                  Jack and Lang were over the thwarts in an instant, but
 as the boat swung clear Christian grasped the oar with which the boat
                  was being levered out into the tide-way. "Stop, 
Morris!" he began, clapping hand to the pistol in his belt. He did not 
finish
                  the sentence, for Morris struck at him with the heavy 
end of a broken oar, so that he fell face downwards in the seaweed.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">A gust of wind filled the jib, and the 
boat edged free of the kelpage out of the lee of the sloping cliffs. But
 Maori Jack,
                  with a pointing forefinger to the red stain that 
followed in its wake, said, "My God, you've killed him! I heard his 
skull
                  crack,"—and sat down on the bottom of the boat, 
moaning.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Haul in that —— mainsheet, can't you?"
 answered Morris, savagely, "or we'll have that —— riddling us with 
shot-holes!"— and
                  he cried out derisively to the other constable, who, 
after firing a couple of ineffective shots, bent over the motionless
                  figure that lay with the water lapping over it in 
little waves.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">And then, looking over at Maori Jack, 
still crouched in the stern with his gaze bent to the white trail that 
followed the
                  keel: "You cowards!" Morris said, in sudden rage; 
"you'll swing for this as well as me!"—answering the horror that spoke 
in
                  the others' eyes.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The boat slowly made way across to 
where the shadow of Heemskirk lay on Strahan, and the harbour spread 
behind them a plate
                  of silver rippled with leaden lines that seared its 
surface ever and again.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"They caught us with the kegs comin' up
 the gully," said the Butcher, thickly; "me an' Maori; an' Christian 
fired at us, an'<span class="pb"> [PAGE 190] </span>we run for the boat,
 didn't we, Maori?" But Maori Jack, speaking for the first time since 
they had left the beach, cried out,
                  "My God! look there!"—still pointing astern. There was
 a white spot over against Dead Island, silhouetted on the dark 
background
                  of the squall that was heading towards them across the
 harbour. The police-boat was already on its way to Strahan with the
                  news.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The moon had risen in a ghastly redness
 when they beached their boat near the mouth of Stockyard Creek, hiding 
her carefully
                  in the dense tea-tree which was rooted well out into 
the water. "We may want her again," said Morris, "if"—— There was a 
grimness
                  in the unfinished sentence that sent the Butcher off 
into a nervous chuckle.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">They got swags and tucker at Lang's 
hut, and then, crossing the button-grass, were lost in the dark shadows 
that canopied
                  the track. A couple of miles out they cut the Hobart 
wire just five minutes after a message had passed along that barred 
every
                  port in Tasmania to them, and sent half-a-dozen 
mounted troopers, a few hours later, jingling along the Linda track on 
their
                  road to Strahan.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The slopes of the Frenchman's Cap are 
honeycombed with caves; and in the dense scrub that clothes the gullies 
running in to
                  the base of the mountain, men in search of solitude 
might defy an army of seekers. The refugees could afford to laugh at the
                  handful who were making ineffectual efforts to 
discover their whereabouts. And, after a space, this was realised, and 
the
                  hunt was limited to a patrol party that moved up and 
down the Linda track investigating the little district outrages this
                  side of Arrowsmith—all laid to the discredit of Morris
 and his gang of two.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Worn out by exposure and scanty food, 
the outlaws at last had to abandon their stronghold and make a dash for 
freedom. Morris
                  recognised the grim necessity when he saw the other 
two whispering apart, and read their furtive looks. There were two 
chances:
                  one a traverse through the forest, making to come out 
at the Huon<span class="pb"> [PAGE 191] </span>below Hobart; the other, 
to make for the mainland by boat. Sailor Jack, a law-abiding scoundrel 
of their acquaintance, had
                  caused them to be informed through one of their 
"telegraphs" that he was willing, for a consideration, to let them have 
their
                  own boat some dark night at the Gordon mouth. But they
 had no money, and Sailor Jack, with unfeeling caution, insisted on
                  a spot-cash transaction. "By God, then, we'll risk a 
dash through Strahan and get the —— boat for ourselves!" said Morris
                  at the end of a weary debate, cutting the knot of 
their difficulty.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">And so it was that one evening they 
came to be skulking along the Linda track where it takes a bend to avoid
 a curl of the
                  Collingwood River. They had barely time to plunge into
 the undergrowth that belted the track, at the sound of horses' hoofs.
                  A squad of troopers jingled by so closely that Morris 
could with ease have picked off any one of them with his drawn revolver;
                  and their careless talk came plainly to his ears. 
Another bend, and the troopers were gone.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">But Morris, beyond the brushwood, had 
seen a little spiral of smoke rising among the timber at the foot of the
 gully. The
                  three of them scrambled down, and, after much 
reconnoitring, found in the dusk of the myrtles a rough-built hut. And 
in the
                  doorway sat "old man Vedder," smoking in silent 
contemplation, as if never a living thing were near beside the 
"popjockeys"
                  whistling in the underbrush, and the little ring-tail 
'possums that lived a friendly life in the blackwood that bent over
                  the hut-roof.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Out of earshot, the three discussed the
 situation, and came to the one possible decision. Vedder must have 
provisions and
                  might have gold, a few ounces of which would enable 
them to purchase Sailor Jack's proffered co-operation.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Maori Jack kept watch amongst the ferns
 on a little eminence outside the timber, while the others stealthily 
approached the
                  hut from the rear. The crack of a branch over which 
Morris tripped in the gloom betrayed them, and the hut-door was hastily
                  shut in their faces, but not before Lang had put a 
foot over the threshold.<span class="pb"> [PAGE 192] </span>With his 
shoulders he burst his way in, to find himself gripped in Vedder's thin,
 nervy arms. As they lay struggling on the
                  floor, Morris pulled a revolver from a pouch and fired
 into Vedder's side. His grasp on Morris's throat relaxed, and he lay
                  still, while a little red stream ran from under his 
body and followed the angles of the rough floor.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Lang offered little thanks for the 
assistance. "You fool!" he cried; "are you mad? This'll bring the traps 
down on us,"—and
                  he edged to the door, holding his shirt-sleeve to his 
throat where Vedder's nails had torn great angry lacerations.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Fill your tucker-bag!" answered 
Morris, laughing wildly, and himself continued to ransack every corner 
of the room in eager
                  haste, tearing down shelves and overturning boxes in 
wild confusion.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">There came the call of a 
mountain-thrush from up the gully, and Morris whistled back the same 
note. Lang made for the door
                  with his swag. "They've heard that shot, damn you!" he
 said as he went.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Morris, as a last chance, prised up the
 hearth-stone, saw a little canvas-bag, grabbed it, and rushed out after
 the others.
                  At the crest above there were three troopers running 
towards them, not a hundred yards away. The ambuscade had been 
successful.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Morris followed his mate up a cut-off, 
curving away from the track round the extreme verge of the cliff. At a 
bend which hid
                  him for the moment from his pursuers, he seized a 
sapling, swung himself over the edge, and lay quiet as the troopers 
clattered
                  by on foot, not noticing in the darkness the scared 
white face that looked up at them out of the bed of fan-fern on the 
cliff-edge.
                  Morris lay motionless until in the distance two shots 
rang out—the last, the quick crack of a rifle. Then he slid down from
                  rock to rock, helped by the undergrowth that hid in 
the fissures weather-worn into the smooth cliff-face, compassing such
                  feats as would have tried stronger nerves than his in 
fair daylight. Reaching the level where the Broken Creek wound its way,
                  he ran along the open avenue of button-grass flat at 
the edge of the creek till his breath<span class="pb"> [PAGE 193] </span>failed
 him, and then he lay panting, with the bag of gold still inside the 
bosom of his shirt.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He had lost his matches, and could only
 appraise his treasure roughly by weight. Light for its bulk, he 
thought; but there
                  must be forty or fifty ounces. Fifty ounces—two 
hundred pounds! His breathing grew easier, and his lair smoother as he 
fondled
                  and caressed his bundle. It was dear to him as life 
itself. It meant life itself! Plenty of assistance to be bought with the
                  contents of this little bag. He rejoiced that 
Lang—cursed, interfering fool— was dead. The silence that followed the 
rifle-shot
                  meant that. Shot like a trapped dog, probably, about a
 quarter of a mile on, where the track "blinded" into the cliff. Morris
                  laughed to himself as he pictured the Butcher standing
 with his back to the cliff up which he had no time to climb by the
                  rough step-notches cut in the face—perhaps, if fear 
had made him brave, chancing the steep descent, and pitching from rock
                  to rock till he lay a bundle of red flesh at the foot.
 Morris started in alarm at the thought. If the Butcher had done a jump,
                  they'd follow him down; if not now, then in the 
morning. But he quickly reassured himself. There would have been more 
rifle-shots
                  than the one that came to him. No, Lang—curse him!—was
 dead on the cliff above, with a carbine bullet in him. Good riddance!
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Maori Jack had said that old man Vedder
 was mad, and never was on gold. Maori Jack could die, too—curse him!—so
 long as <i>he</i> was safe. And then, from pure exhaustion, his brain 
ceased to work, and he slept where he lay buried in the ferns.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">In the morning he awoke and shook 
himself; and, with a sudden terror, as his memory came back to him, put 
hand to side to
                  feel if the bag was secure. He opened it and poured 
out a couple of ounces of the contents on a plate of bark. And then, 
suddenly,
                  as he played with his fingers among the little heap of
 shining yellow that glistened in the sun newly breaking above the 
Frenchman—with
                  eyes dilated and a smile of content set on his 
features in ghastly petrifaction—he plunged his hand into the bag and 
held
                  the palmful of metal to his eyes. Then, with maniacal 
laughter, he rose<span class="pb"> [PAGE 194] </span>and fled, holding 
tight in his hand the little canvas bag, while he climbed and climbed 
like the lost traveller whose wits
                  have left him in the horror of the big bush. And ever 
and anon came his horrid laugh, growing wilder and wilder in the 
distance
                  as the mountain sides bandied it back and forth in 
quaintest echo.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The troopers wound their way back to 
Strahan, bearing among them a motionless burden on a rudely-contrived 
litter. One of
                  them had his upper arm bound about with a bloody 
handkerchief.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Sergeant Leggath, who was in advance, 
suddenly reined back his horse, and pointed dumbly to a big granite 
boulder alongside
                  the track.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Outlined against the dawn stood a 
figure familiar, although the clothes hung upon it in strips like the 
bark of a swamp myrtle.
                  "Stand, in the Queen's name!" called the sergeant, 
loudly, and a wild laugh and a revolver-shot came in answer. A raw young
                  private, who had been fingering nervously at the 
trigger of his carbine, sighted and pulled.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Morris stood for two seconds, and then 
plunged heavily forward and lay still in the undergrowth twenty feet 
below, with one
                  empty hand dabbling in the current of the pool that 
washed the base of the boulder.

               <p class="noindent">I PADDLED up the river.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I was tired of civilisation and its 
products, so I turned my back upon the city and bore up against the 
tide. The river set
                  its current against me and bore down for civilisation 
and the city.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The river was an Australian river, and 
its winding reaches were framed in gnarled stems and twisted branches of
 quaint device,
                  in twining creepers and drooping, lance-shaped leaves,
 in rough boulders and grim caves where the black man had crouched 
beside
                  his boomerang and devoured his feast of shell-fish.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">But the caves now bear the legend of 
Smith, Brown and Jones; the boulders advertise patent soaps; among 
clearings in tortuous
                  gum-bush gleam the white turrets of the modern villa; 
on the slopes the creepers have been cut away for the straight, trim
                  beds of artificial garden.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The legends and the soaps, the villas 
and the gardens, are all products of civilisation.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I paddled up the river.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Suddenly I came upon a Relic of 
Romance. A dismantled chimney, a ruined wall over which trailed fresh 
green leaves, an old
                  horse browsing where a cottage room had been, some 
soft-eyed cattle gazing at me,—all the elements of a domestic idyll. I
                  stepped ashore to shed a few tears over the idyll and 
analyse the elements; some of them resolved themselves into disused
                  boilers pervaded by a peculiar odour.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then I remembered. I stood on the site 
of a boiling-down establishment which had once polluted the air.</p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 196] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">The boiling-down process was a product,
 and it had moved down the river.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I paddled up.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">At a bend of the stream rose a tall 
building, with straight lines, jutting outhouses and gabled roof. Some 
terraced cottages
                  stood near, also straight-lined and gable-roofed. 
Opposite, twining greenery and rich underscrub and starry flannel-flower
                  nestled in the curve under the shadow of the cool 
cliff. Here, utilitarian energy bristled in the glare.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I went inside the building. It was a 
factory, with whirring wheels and ponderous grindstones and huge vats, 
all used in the
                  production of a fancy food for digestions spoiled by 
civilisation. Strong men were busy among the machines, slight women were
                  busy in the packing-rooms. I spoke to one of the 
girls: she was young and not uncomely; her head was bent and her nimble 
fingers
                  folded squares of cardboard into box-form and pasted 
on the paper covers.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"How many can you make in a day?" I 
asked.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"About three hundred," she answered in a
 monotone, her fingers still folding.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Outside, the mullet were leaping, the 
loose-leaved branches were idly waving to other branches in the water, 
the laugh of
                  the kookaburra pealed in the distance.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Inside, the sun streamed hotly on pale 
faces and tired fingers.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I looked at the girl,—her face was 
dainty and wistful.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Don't you sometimes hate it?" I said.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The girl looked at me, and answered:</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yes."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">She was a product of civilisation and 
was drifting down the river. I paddled up.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">At last I lighted on my camping-ground.
 It was roomy and retired, protected by a shore of black ooze and a 
cliff undisfigured
                  by names; a waterhole was near at hand. I contentedly 
lighted my camp-fire, and sat down to meditate on products.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 197] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">Suddenly a boatful of them arrived and 
took possession. They were undeniable: male products in speckless 
flannels, straw hats
                  and city respectability; female products in gay 
draperies and city smirk.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I fled to my waterhole. There the water
 dripped with a musical patter down the ruddy cliffs; the yellow 
"speckle-eye" flitted
                  about the branches with cheerful chirp; the sunbeams 
quivered through the interweaving leaves; the locusts played their 
bagpipes
                  with a subdued drone. I was listening to it when the 
product in flannels swooped down on me, armed with curiosity and 
conversation.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Nice place," he said, annexing my 
waterhole; "nice soap," appropriating mine; "nice weather, nice 
camping-ground, nice to
                  get away from the city now and then."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">When I went back the products were 
gathered round my fire, crooning "Daisy Bell" preparatory to going down 
the river. I paddled
                  up.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">On the oozy bank I spied, afar off, a 
flamingo stalking in the mud. On nearing, my flamingo resolved itself 
into an elderly
                  gentleman in a red shirt paddling for bait.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">This looked like close intimacy with 
Nature. I made advances to the flamingo, which presently took a bath, 
resumed human attire,
                  and conducted me over a thriving orchard.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I admired a fruitful vine on a barren 
rock. I marvelled at a peach-bearing tree which had sprung into 
existence in a crevice.
                  I stood beneath a forty-year-old apple-tree which 
formed a natural bower, and dreamed of the children who had frolicked 
under
                  its boughs.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The flamingo's voice broke in:</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I don't get half I used to for them 
apples," it said; "if I couldn't do my own cartage by road I'd give the 
land up; it don't
                  pay these days."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The flamingo was also a product.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I paddled up the river.</p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 198] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">I swerved aside to enter a sinuous 
creek, just wide enough for my boat. On one marshy side tall rushes 
grew, on the other
                  old trees caressed my head with their drooping boughs.
 The water rippled under the keel, and a dog's baying echoed far away.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I drifted up to a thickly-set orchard, 
with a soft carpet of green weed beneath the peach-and 
nectarine-dropping trees. In
                  the fore ground a group of men were busy sorting fruit
 and packing it in market cases.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The master stood up, a tall, well-built
 young fellow, and as I stepped on shore he came forward with grave 
courtesy:</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You are a stranger," he said; "and——" 
his glance wandered uneasily from my unkempt beard, doubtful garments, 
and bare feet,
                  to the boat. She was trim and shipshape. His glance 
returned, satisfied. "And an artist?" he continued; "a good many come
                  our way. You are welcome. The orchard is more 
interesting further on, and you will find some fruit to your liking."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">So I had lighted on Paradise at last, 
and civilisation was in the rear. As I lay under the enclosing boughs of
 a pear-tree
                  that had seen three generations, catching glimpses, 
between the clustering fruit, of tree-ferns guarding scarlet tomato and
                  ripening watermelon,—with the murmur of the creek, the
 buzz of the bee, and the hum of the fly in my ear,—I felt I had nothing
                  to reproach Adam and Eve with. Their little interview 
with the serpent had not robbed me of Nature's spoils.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">But another sound disturbed my reverie.
 A sibilant sound, recalling city products. Creeping forward stealthily,
 I peered through
                  the branches, and there, in the gathering shadows, I 
spied a pair—of the species known as larrikin. They were hard at work,
                  too, and the bags beside them suggested weight.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">A hand fell on my shoulder.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Will you help me?" said the quiet 
voice of the sturdy young farmer. "We are evenly matched, and if we 
surprise them it will
                  be a sure thing."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">It was a sure thing. Within 
half-an-hour the invaders were on their way towards the hospitable 
police-station. Apparently<span class="pb"> [PAGE 199] </span>they were 
waste products. I had come painfully near civilisation again.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I am much indebted to you," said the 
farmer. "They would have escaped had I lost time going to look for my 
men, and really
                  this sort of thing is not to be borne. The rights of 
property are sacred; I see you are with me there."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I was not with him there, because I 
have no property. My boat was a hired one. But I understood.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Still, I was sorry. It struck me that 
my farmer was a product, too, in his own simple fashion, and that I had 
not yet wandered
                  far enough.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I wished to paddle up the river.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Wait," said the farmer; "you must come
 up to the house; we both need a drink after that little affair."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"This stuff won't harm anyone," he 
added presently, holding up the aromatic golden liquor to the light. 
"You don't find this
                  brand in every house, and where you do it's not always
 genuine."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I glanced at the brand; it was 
"Bertrandt and Co." Bertrandt is the rich godfather to whom I look for a
 legacy.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Do they dare to tamper with it?" I 
asked righteously.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Tampering with Bertrandt's brandy might
 affect my legacy.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Not with this," laughed the farmer; "I
 have special opportunities for securing the real thing,"—and he 
whispered a word in
                  my ear. "We all like our little comforts, and we like 
them good," he added cheerily.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yes," I answered absently, "we like 
them good."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Was it really five years since I had 
written to Bertrandt.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then I realised that I also was a 
product.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I paddled down the river.</p>

               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 200] </span><h4 class="normal">An
 Error In Administration.</h4>
               A. C. M'Cay
               
               <p class="noindent">SMITH was brought up in the city, 
though his fathers before him had been men of the forest and sea; and he
 naturally became
                  a clerk. But the blood asserted itself, and he threw 
away his billet to go up-country, and finally got a job on a Gippsland
                  selection, where he spent his days and nights in the 
"cleared country" with the sheep. In Gippsland the country is thoroughly
                  cleared when most of the undergrowth has been hacked 
or burned away, and the trees ringbarked so that they all stand dead.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Such a country is bad for the nerves, 
especially for those of a man like Smith, whose father had not been 
particularly virtuous.
                  It consists of an interminable stretch of gaunt gray 
timber, and in the morning and evening twilight the dead trees seem to
                  wobble their crooked arms towards one another, and 
join their skeleton hands in a ghastly, jerky minuet which makes your 
flesh
                  creep. They begin to do this when you have known them 
for about a week; and very soon, if you have a steady head and an 
adequate
                  supply of tobacco, they stop, and turn into inanimate 
timber again. But an ex-clerk who has been addicted to inhaling 
cheap-cigarette
                  smoke, and finds a pipe too much for him, sees their 
antics for a good while longer. When the darkness has put a stop to this
                  entertainment, the sheep sometimes get restless, and 
an unquiet flock of sheep at midnight makes a most dispiriting noise,
                  which is a shade worse than the dead stillness. 
Sometimes, too, a tree falls without any apparent reason just as you are
 dropping
                  off to sleep; and when a Gippsland tree comes down it 
shakes a whole hillside and sounds louder than a cannon. Altogether,
                  a cleared selection in South Gippsland is a cheerless 
home for a solitary neurotic man.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">So it came to pass that Smith 
contracted many little<span class="pb"> [PAGE 201] </span>peculiarities 
in his behaviour. He would spend hours on his back, looking up towards 
the sky and trying to fix the outline
                  of a tree on his mind, and it always vexed him that he
 forgot one limb as soon as he set himself to master the next. He began
                  to talk to the sheep like human beings, for he had no 
dog; and he swore at them because they did not answer him in English
                  and he had forgotten the French and Latin he had 
learnt at school. He got tired of the trees being so gray, and he took 
to
                  staining them with grass, and watering their bases in 
the hope of making them sprout again. He was conscious that there was
                  something wrong in his being out there all alone, and 
he came to the conclusion that he had a deadly enemy somewhere, but
                  he couldn't quite settle who it was. It wasn't the 
sheep, for they seemed as frightened as himself; and it wasn't the 
trees,
                  for two of them had fallen within a chain of his hut 
without doing any damage. After this event he regarded them as his 
especial
                  friends, and he laughed and clapped his hands when the
 dance got more than usually mixed—in the mazurka, for instance. At
                  other than twilight hours he sat still and brooded 
over his wrongs.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">One day the boss rode out himself 
instead of sending a man with Smith's rations, and explained that he 
intended to build new
                  yards where the hut stood, because the railway was 
going to pass right there. The shepherd smiled as if he did n't quite 
understand,
                  and said that the railway would find it rather lonely,
 and he hoped it wouldn't hurt his trees. "They're just learning the
                  quadrilles," he said. The boss stared at him and went 
away. Soon after, a couple of men came and told Smith to take his sheep
                  out of the road, and he drew off and watched them for 
the rest of the afternoon. When it dawned on him what they were going
                  to do, and he saw the destruction of all his hopes of 
the grand chain in the evening, he went up and asked them who had 
ordered
                  it. Then he sat down and thought a great deal about 
the boss, until at last he came to a decision.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Now it is very clear that the 
Government of Victoria has much to answer for. If it had not decided to 
build that railway,
                  Smith's trees would have been left untouched, and he 
might have gone on<span class="pb"> [PAGE 202] </span>quite harmlessly 
until it was discovered that big timber was bad for his brain. The sheep
 would not have been left alone that
                  night while a man with a sharpened knife made his way 
to the homestead. The kitchen-maid would not have been driven screaming
                  along the passage, three men would have been without a
 very exciting experience of ten minutes' duration, and one of them
                  would not walk lame. Also, the boss's only son would 
be two months younger and a good deal stronger, and his wife would be
                  able to give an intelligent answer to a simple 
question—which, as matters stand, she cannot do.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Smith came out, probably, better than

 to a situation

of big timber in a lifetime. If he ever happens to get into different
                  country, most probably someone will be murdered.

Bridal Party and A Dog.</h4>
               "Omega"
               
               <p class="noindent">IT was afternoon when I rode into 
Bear Gully. I was bound for the railway-station five miles north, and at
 first thought to
                  ride straight through the almost-deserted hamlet. Bear
 Gully had once a dozen or so houses. That was before the 
railway-station
                  opened in the north. Now the pub. was the only 
inhabited dwelling in the place, and it lingered partly to catch 
teamsters
                  and occasional wanderers, and partly, seemingly, 
because it was used to lingering there and never thought of shifting.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The day was hot and steamy after late 
rain. Several puddles of water studded the flat in front. The pub. 
verandah was odiously
                  dirty. Mud was spattered on the posts and on the 
weatherboard walls, and the entire establishment looked disreputable in 
the
                  extreme. A brown shabby dog of mixed collie and 
retriever breed lay at the far end of the verandah, and eyed me in a 
peculiarly
                  suspicious way. However, throwing the bridle over a 
hook, I walked in.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Anyone here?" I asked. There were 
glasses on the counter and bottles on a shelf behind, but no one in 
attendance.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Anyone here?" I repeated. Thinking the
 publican might be temporarily busy elsewhere, I turned out of the bar 
to have a look
                  at the dog, whose appearance had attracted me.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The brute had partly struggled to his 
feet and was snapping at something, to me invisible, which seemed to 
annoy him. He was
                  as dirty as his surroundings, with large lumps of mud 
sticking here and there to his shaggy sides. As I approached him, in
                  making a particularly vicious snap over his right 
shoulder, he overbalanced and rolled on his back. I went closer. His 
eyes
                  were shut, but he moved his head spasmodically, and 
every few seconds snapped at<span class="pb"> [PAGE 204] </span>some 
unseen enemy. I judged his complaint to be a kind of local paralysis 
combined with illusions of the senses.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Going back, I re-entered the bar. To my
 surprise a red, swollen-faced man sat behind the counter.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Hello," I said, "I thought the house 
abandoned. Is n't it hot?" The man was looking towards, but beyond me. 
His eyes were
                  bloodshot and the lids heavy.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What'll y' 'ave?" he asked, almost in a
 whisper. I wished I had ridden on, but as things had gone so far I 
determined to
                  make the best of them.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"A little whisky," I answered. "It's 
terrible work riding in this clammy heat." He gripped the counter with 
one hand, while
                  reaching for the bottle with the other. He looked at 
the bottle as he looked at me—that is, he appeared to be looking far
                  away beyond it. Catching it, however, he placed it 
before me.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You don't seem very well," I remarked.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">No answer.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"That's a queer dog of yours outside," I
 added.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">No answer.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I swallowed the drink and placed a 
shilling on the counter. The man put the bottle back, picked up the 
shilling in a dreamy,
                  death-like silence, and then, with a shout that shook 
the rafters, jumped several feet in the air, and turning round, rushed
                  through the bar entrance into an adjoining room. 
Recovering from the shock, I followed him. I had heard a crash, and 
concluded
                  he had fallen over something. He had; and there he lay
 on the floor, evidently injured, though to what extent I could not
                  tell.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What's up?" I asked. He made desperate
 efforts to rise, but knee or ankle was damaged and he could not get on 
his feet. But
                  he snapped at me with his mouth, and, when I stood 
aside out of his view, he snapped and struck at objects invisible to me.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Who the mischief's looking after this 
den?" I mused, walking through the house to the rear of the premises. In
 a large room,
                  like a bushman's dining-room, my eye caught a youngish
 man in shirt and trousers, sitting at a heavy table, engaged at some
                  absorbing<span class="pb"> [PAGE 205] </span>work. His
 face was toward me, and, though he was unshaven and unwashed, I at once
 set him down for a city clerk.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Well, now," I began, walking in; "I'm 
glad to come on someone in his senses. What's up with the party inside?"
 By this time
                  I noticed that the heavy wooden table was pitted all 
over with small cavities, some the size of marbles, and others as large
                  as eggcups, and that my new acquaintance was busily 
digging out a fresh one with his sheath knife. He did not notice my 
words,
                  but worked on.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What do all these holes mean?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"<i>Sh—sh!</i>" he whispered. "I'm 
getting 'em all out. Oh, they can't escape me! Centipedes—see? 
Scorpions—see? I'm getting 'em out! I'm
                  getting 'em out!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Whipping a wriggling shaving of wood 
from the hole he worked on, he threw it on the floor and, with 
blood-curdling yells,
                  jumped and danced on it. When the fit was over he 
resumed his seat and went on calmly with his work.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">As I unhitched my horse the cross-bred 
collie, still snapping at the air, wriggled to the edge of the verandah,
 and rolled
                  over into a pool of water on the road beneath.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I didn't look back. "I'll report the 
facts to the authorities," I said, "and leave the job to them." On 
turning the first
                  bend in the road I came flush on a horse and trap.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Ye're fram beyant?" asked a sergeant 
of police who drove the trap. "Did ye lave them all well?" Then he 
informed me that
                  he and the constable sitting beside him were bound for
 the Bear pub. to carry away the remaining inmates.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Ye see," went on the sergeant, "we tuk
 away the wimmin this marnin'. It all came about through a weddin' as 
done it. The
                  darter of the oul' man was spliced three weeks ago to a
 young fella, a clerk from town, an' they kep' the cellybrashun up

               <p class="normal">"And the dog?" I said.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"<i>An</i>' the dog," said the 
sergeant. "The dog's ivery bit as bad as the rest. It's the worst case 
of profligacy iver occurred in

of them. This'll burst up the Bear pub. annyway, an' it's a good job.
                  Will ye ride back wid us?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No, sergeant, thank you. I'm in a 
hurry. I'll not want to see the bridal party or its dog any more."</p>

               <p class="normal">He had often said it before, but 
whenever he saw his wife's rich brown hair hanging down, his artistic

               <p class="normal">"I do believe that is the tenth time 
this week you have said that," she replied, laughing up at him. "Yes, I

stooping position.</p>

think of those days now. They have gone. All my best days are before me.

                  the fervour of truth in her voice, "I thank God every 
night for my happiness—for having met you. I love you so. I would die
                  for you!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She put her arms round his neck. "I 
don't believe any woman ever loved a man as I do you."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He laughed and kissed her.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"It was well, too, for me that I

               <p class="normal">She dropped her arms and spoke 
hurriedly. "Ted, when shall we go and see the Gap? You promised me a 
week ago, and the wet
                  weather may set in any time."
               </p>

               <p class="normal">"To-day? This morning?" He nodded. "Oh,
 that will be splendid."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">She clapped her hands, and her face 
flushed with pleasure at the thought of the happy day before her. She 
was all eagerness
                  to start.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I will run and put on my dress now. 
And you won't be long with the horses, will you? I will ride Lightning 
to-day."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">A horse galloped up the path. Chalice 
couldn't see, but she knew who it was. It was Tom O'Connor from Tawonga 
station with
                  the mails. Her husband went to meet him; she heard a 
few murmuring words, and, as was the usual custom, heard Tom dismount
                  and walk into the dining-room with Ted. She knew she 
needn't hurry in dressing now, for Tom was such a talker. She played
                  lovingly with her wedding-ring. Three months married! 
How the time had passed! It seemed only yesterday that—God! she mustn't
                  commence to think, else—she began humming to drown her
 thoughts. How beautiful the wattle looked! There was a branch bending
                  down to the verandah, laden with blossoms. The yellow 
would look pretty against her dress.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She finished dressing, and stepped out 
and picked a bunch.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">A slight, stifled scream escaped her as
 she looked towards the horse. This wasn't Tom's sturdy little 
chestnut—this great,
                  black, sweating horse! It turned its head. She 
staggered against the wall. What a fool she was! More men than one had a
 black
                  horse with a white mark on its forehead. It must be a 
station-hand's. She would go and pat it. She went up closer. Her hand
                  extended, but swiftly drew back again. Her eyes 
dilated with fright and fear. <i>The stitches!</i> The stitches in the 
saddle-cloth that she had sewn in six months ago stared her in the face!
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Blindly groping her way to her window, 
she wondered, dully, what they were saying in the dining-room. She must 
hear. She<span class="pb"> [PAGE 209] </span>must know. She would go 
along the verandah. No, they would see her, they would hear her—she 
would go through the bath-room,
                  and steal quietly along till she came to the door.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">As she crept along the hall, a deep, 
mellow voice was speaking. She clenched her teeth.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Edward Murray stood with his back to 
the speaker, and played with his watch-chain.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Chalice isn't even her name. She 
adopted it as a tribute to her own beauty. She would have liked every 
man to have drunk
                  of her. Many men have. Even I; and even"—with a savage
 glance at the obstinately-turned back—"you!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The woman crouched outside like a 
beaten cur.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"She drove her old mother to the grave.
 She has played with men as with flowers, tossing them aside when tired 
of their fragrance.
                  She would have been another man's mistress, if I had 
not come along—so she chose me. The house you took her from three months
                  ago was my house. And if you had looked you would have
 found a little grave——"

               <p class="normal">The door-handle made a rasping 
noise—the man stopped speaking; the handle turned, and before he could 
rise from his chair
                  the slash of a riding-whip had come across his face.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Furious and blinded with pain, he 
sprang forward, but recoiled as he saw Chalice.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">All her anguish and terror seemed to 
have frozen into her frame. Her arm was held high up, the whip grasped 
in her tense fingers.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The man turned his eyes away from her 
white face.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">There was a moment's silence.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">She felt she was going mad. She should 
not have come in so soon. She should have waited till her husband had 
spoken, then——
                  O God! why didn't he speak? Why didn't he move? Even 
shuffle his feet—anything! Anything was better than his standing like
                  a silent, awful Fate behind her!
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She caught the click of his chain, as 
he threw it up and down.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He sauntered up to her.</p>

the floor.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He put his hand on her shoulder and 
half-whispered into her ear.</p>

compensations, my little wife? The chirping of the cricket, the trilling

these things you used so poetically to tell me about, have not, then,

this man a liar? Perhaps," taking her hands and patting them, "you are 
shy!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">She looked up at him, all her dumb 
agony in her eyes.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"As shy, perhaps, as the day I knocked 
at your door, down by the creek, and you opened it, and I looked at you;
 your head
                  drooped with shyness—my little innocent one!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She shivered as he passed his hand 
caressingly over her hair.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"As shy, perhaps, as the day you lent 
me your—er—father's horse—a black one,"—smiling over her head to the man
 opposite him,—"with—er—a
                  white mark on its forehead. And— do you remember?—we 
rode, and rode, and rode, and all else was forgotten. And your hair came
                  tumbling——"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Edward! Edward!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Over your shoulders, and I—kissed—you.
 And your sweet, maidenly blushes !—ha—ha—ha!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">She broke into sobs.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Ah, we had merry times down in that 
little home. Every day brought forth a new pleasure. Every day was 
coloured with our
                  joy—our happiness."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Jack Morton's eyes glared at him.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"How timidly your little hands used to 
seek mine! How your eyes used to sparkle as I approached!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Don't, don't! That time is sacred to 
me."</p>

               <p class="normal">"How lovingly your arms twined round my

               <p class="normal">"Have pity——"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Ah, Chalice, forgive me! I have done 
wrong. This life I have brought you to is too rough—too coarse a setting
 for such a
                  jewel. You must obey the cravings of your spotless 
purity; return to the creek that calls you, to the home that waits for
                  you—to your own virtuous loneliness."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">His hand slid down to hers.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Jack Morton anticipated him. He rushed 
forward, snatched Chalice's hand, wrenched the ring off, and threw it 
with all his
                  force into the other's face.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">There was a moment of terrified 
silence. Mad fury possessed both men. They looked at each other, the 
white, quivering face
                  of Murray contrasting strangely with the dark, 
distorted countenance of Morton.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">A startled sob came between them. 
Murray recovered himself He flicked some dust off his coat. How foolish,
 and what a waste
                  of energy to lose his temper over these two wretches!
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He spoke in a smart, business-like way.
 "I thank you, my man. You have performed that little duty more forcibly
 than ever
                  I would have done. You had both better go now. The 
woman's belongings will be sent on to the station."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He went towards the door. She ran after
 him, hardly understanding.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Ted, Ted !—what do you mean? You are 
not leaving me?" Her voice grew shrill with fear. "You will not go from 
me? No, no,
                  you will have pity; you ... Ted! don't go, don't go!" 
She caught his sleeve, in a vain effort to stop him. He pushed her back.
                  "Oh, have mercy! I love you so. I—oh, God! don't leave
 me." Her sobs choked her. "Let me stay with you. I will not speak to
                  you, nor touch you; only let me see you sometimes. 
Edward," pleadingly, "I will be your servant."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I always insist on my servants being 
clean!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">She gave a little moan. "Yes, yes; but 
you are lifting me.</p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 212] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">You have shown me Heaven. No, no, don't
 go!—you have shown me——" He found it a difficulty to pass through the 
door with her
                  clinging to him. "God! For the sake——" His foot 
advanced and tripped hers. "For the sake—— Ted! don't leave me!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She fell down.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You brute!" roared Jack Morton to the 
closed door.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He ran to pick her up; but she was 
shrieking and beating her hands against the door, and calling on her 
husband. He dropped
                  his head in his hands. He had never seen grief like 
this before; and something like remorse for what he had done was coming
                  to him.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">After a little while her cries grew 
fainter; her breath came in exhausted gasps.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He raised her up.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Chalice, my poor Chalice!" he said, 
brokenly; "don't cry, dear. You must come and live with me again. It 
shall be as if this
                  man had never lived. Hush! And—God forgive me!—I will 
put a ring on your finger this time. My ring will be more sacred, more
                  binding, in my sorrow, than his was, in his weak 
ignorance Come, Chalice, come back with me."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yes, yes, I will come. I don't care, 
now," she said, wildly. "Nothing matters now. Everything is over. Only 
take me away;
                  a long way from here."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Morton swore, under his breath, at the 
hollow misery in her eyes.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He drew her on to the verandah and 
swung her into the saddle. He sprang up behind her. The horse's head was
 turned, and they
                  moved down the path. They had not gone very far when 
she cried out to stop the horse.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Stop, stop!—pull up!" She dragged 
fiercely at the reins. "Jack, pull up! I must see him again. I can't go 
away yet. Loose
                  your hands! He may have called me, and I not have 
heard him. He may"—with a wild hope—"have relented. Let me go—let me 
go!"

               <p class="normal">She dropped to the ground, and ran 
back, the thought of his calling her uppermost in her mind.</p>

 Dispersion of Mrs. Black.</h4>
               "Robin Studholme"
               
               <p class="noindent">"I KNOW," said old Bill, 
meditatively, "that it takes more'n one to get up a proper dispersion, 
but you will find that old
                  woman Black were dispersed pretty wide, for all that.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yer see, it were this way. Old Sol 
Black were a whaler down at Maketu, and like all sich, he got a Maori 
wife and a lot o'kids.
                  Well, his old 'ooman met with a haccident one day in 
war-time. Old Sol used to help the tribe in battle, and on this 
hoccasion
                  they got well licked, and Sol's wife got eat. Sol 
thought he would get a white woman to look after the kids, and he goes 
to
                  Auckland in the Flying Fish and brings one back.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"She were a widder wot never had no 
kids of her own, which was just into Sol's hand. She were a big, fat 
heifer, and it took
                  a tidy plarster to make her a frock, so she seldom 
wore one. She minded the kids all right till they got spliced or went 
off
                  on their own hook.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Arter that the old 'ooman used to go 
about the pah jabbering and chiacking with one and another. She were 
generally barefooted,
                  just like a Maori woman. She kep' pretty straight, 
'cept when there was any rum or square-face about; then she'd get her 
whack
                  anyhow.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"They'd shifted to Rotorua by this 
time, and their whare was on the lake shore; but most of the natives 
lived on the hill. Old Sol was away ketching crawfish in the lake when 
one
                  on'em on the hill got up a five-gallon keg o'rum. The 
old 'ooman smelt it, and was up there on the tear quick. It were dark
                  when she tacked for home, pretty well boozed. There 
was a lot of hot-springs and cooking-holes and biling-pools o'all sorts
                  just off the track; but, Lord! she'd been along that 
track all hours.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 215] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">"Well, there wasn't no one at home, so 
nobody missed her, anyhow. The old go-ashore which was their bell was 
a-sounding for
                  morning prayers, for they prays twice a day, do them 
natives, quite public in the church, and when the first lot got a bit
                  on the track they saw a blanket which had caught by a 
corner on a old tea-tree stump, right acrost the track, and the further
                  corner was just on the edge of the bilingest of all 
them biling springs.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"When they looked in there was a lot of
 hile on the top, and as the water heaved and rolled with the heat of 
hell a lot of
                  whitish, yallerish, flaky and ropy-looking stuff was 
a-rolling round with the hile and water. There was some o'them fresh
                  green ferns on the further edge a-hanging over, and 
by-an'-by a bigger bile-up than common fetched some white rag out from
                  hunder the ferns all lapped and twisted round summut 
hard. The niggers'd got to know afore this what was the matter from the
                  blanket, and when they saw the white rag they was 
certint, 'cos them was all her togs the night afore.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"They fished out the rag and found it 
were lapped and twisted round the neck and breast of pore Mrs. Black. 
The head was biled
                  off and likewise the arms and backbone was broke 
through the middle, what with the rousting about it got when the bile 
was
                  most wiolent, and I allus heard say she were a tender 
critter.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"They didn't know what to do all to 
wonst. They thought if they got her out and put her in a soap-box she'd 
run through the
                  jints. A'larst one on'em who'd been to school said the
 Rumuns used to put their dead 'uns into jars arter burning on 'em to
                  ashes, and stick 'em on the mantel where they was 
allus handy to cry over. He thought a callybash, such as they put birds
                  and pork in when they are biled down in their own fat,
 would about fill the bill, and it would comfort old Sol to have his
                  wife in a funeral hurn, as he called it. He was a rare
 schollard for a native, that chap.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"They agreed to that, and got some old 
bent tin and pumpkin shells, and a canoe baler and a long-handle shovel,
 and ladled
                  the old girl out. The bones was mostly low down 
fooling around in the heddy where the bottom of the hole ought to be.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 216] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">"They kep' the bones separate, and when
 the head came out from hunder the ferns it were quite white and nothin'
 on it to speak
                  on. Some of the red hairs was a-twisted round the 
other pieces, and some was in locks of hair by themselves among the 
hile.
                  Bein' as she were a copper-topped 'un, the hairs 
weren't as heasy to see as black 'uns, but they was very careful.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"They got a good large gourd a couple 
of foot high, open at the top, and they put all the small goods in; but 
the worst job
                  was skimming off the hile, for they said they would 
like her to be all there. But she weren't, for I see a good-looking 
Maori
                  wench a-fishing out the finger and toe-nails with a 
pawa shell, and she wore 'em for a necklace the next day.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"The shovel came in werry handy for 
skimming the hile. The worst was keeping the water out; and they said if
 that was scooped
                  up and put in the <i>hipu</i>, it might be unpleasant 
for various reasons to Sol when he went to weep beside the hurn.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"A'larst they got her fixed and a flat 
bit of tin on the openin', and they said they'd stand the jimmy on top 
of that to give
                  it a proper finish like. It were a melancholy 
business.—some o'the women was a-crying and a-howling all the time. The 
bones
                  they tied together wery neat and put 'em in a case 
o'titara bark what had had smoked heels in. Then they concluded to put
                  it in the store out of the way of the kids, who might 
think she were pork if left in the whare.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"When Sol came back he was quite 
pleased with the pains they'd took, and he had a good look at her and 
gave her a nod when
                  he left, but he didn't go and weep beside the hurn, 
and the schollard said that was because he wasn't a Rumun which they 
thought
                  he were.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Well, she stood on that shelf for 
years and nobody took no liberties with her, and the sight of her bony 
face kept the kids
                  away, till one day a tourist came along who wanted to 
get the skull of a cannybul for a skyantific society, and one o'the
                  young men sold Mrs. Black's skull for half-a-crown and
 a long beer.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 217] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">"That was the beginning on it. Yer see,
 there was no brand on when the head was was gone, same as all on us, 
and no telling
                  what was inside the <i>hipu.</i> Old Sol never went 
there, and the tomb of Mrs. Black was neglected by him as ought to have 
decked it with flowers as is common.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"By-an'-by the kids got to shovin' 
their fingers in when they got a chance, but they seemed to want 
henthoosiasm, and she
                  didn't get scattered much that way; but there was an 
old <i>tohunga</i> priest there as carved things out o'human bone, and 
he came acrost the bark case o'bones one day when he was a-skirmishing
                  around for dried heels. He looted 'em, and made two 
flutes and some hornaments they call <i>aurei</i> and a search-warrant 
for the hair and a whole biling o'fish-hooks out of Mrs. Black's bones, 
and, bein' a noted <i>tohunga,</i> he sold 'em to all the tribes of both
 islands.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Then they was going pigeon-shooting 
one day and one of the young fellows dropped on the <i>hipu</i> with 
Mrs. Black in it. Yer see, she looked summut like mutton-bird hile. 
Well, they hiled their guns with her and their bridles
                  and saddles, and them as 'ad boots hiled them; and the
 thick part of her at the bottom of the <i>hipu</i> they threw into the 
lake, and the gold and silver fishes scoffed her, and that just about 
spread out poor Mrs. Black.

               A. B. Paterson
               
               <p class="noindent">BUCKALONG was a big freehold of some 
eighty thousand acres, belonging to an absentee syndicate, and therefore
 run in a most
                  niggardly style. There was a manager on two hundred 
pounds a year, Sandy M'Gregor to wit—a hard-headed old Scotchman known
                  as "four-eyed M'Gregor," because he wore spectacles. 
For assistants, he had half-a-dozen of us—jackeroos and 
colonial-experiencers—who
                  got nothing a year, and earned it. We had, in most 
instances, paid premiums to learn the noble art of squatting, which now
                  appears to me hardly worth studying, for so much 
depends on luck that a man with a head as long as a horse's has little 
better
                  chance than the fool just imported. Besides the 
manager and the jackeroos, there were a few boundary-riders to prowl 
round
                  the fences of the vast paddocks. This constituted the 
whole station staff.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Buckalong was on one of the main routes
 by which stock were taken to market, or from the plains to the 
tablelands, and <i>vice versa.</i> Great mobs of travelling sheep 
constantly passed through the run, eating up the grass and vexing the 
soul of the manager.
                  By law, sheep must travel six miles per day, and they 
must keep within half-a-mile of the road. Of course we kept all the
                  grass near the road eaten bare, to discourage 
travellers from coming that way. Such hapless wretches as did venture 
through
                  Buckalong used to try hard to stray from the road and 
pick up a feed, but old Sandy was always ready for them, and would have
                  them dogged right through the run. This bred feuds, 
and bad language, and personal combats between us and the drovers, whom
                  we looked upon as natural enemies. Then the men who 
came through with mobs of cattle used to pull down the paddock fences
                  at night, and slip the cattle in for refreshments;<span
 class="pb"> [PAGE 219] </span>but old Sandy often turned out at two or 
three a.m. to catch a big mob of bullocks in the horse-paddock, and then
 off they
                  went to Buckalong pound. The drovers, as in duty 
bound, attributed the trespass to accident—broken rails, and so on—and 
sometimes
                  they tried to rescue the cattle, which again bred 
strife and police-court summonses.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Besides having a particular aversion to
 drovers, old M'Gregor had a general "down" on the young "colonials," 
whom he comprehensively
                  described as a "feckless, horse-dealin', 
horse-stealin', crawlin' lot o' wretches." According to him, a native 
would sooner
                  work a horse to death than work for a living, any day.
 He hated any man who wanted to sell him a horse. "As ah walk the 
street,"
                  he used to say, "the folk disna stawp me to buy claes 
nor shoon, an' wheerfore should they stawp me to buy horrses? It's 
'Mister
                  M'Gregor, will ye purrchase a horrse?' Let them wait 
till I ask them to come wi' theer horrses."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Such being his views on horseflesh and 
drovers, we felt no little excitement when one Sunday, at dinner, the 
cook came in
                  to say that "a drover-chap outside wants the boss to 
come and have a look at a horse." M'Gregor simmered awhile, and muttered
                  something about the "Sawbath day"; but at last he went
 out, and we filed after him to see the fun.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The drover stood by the side of his 
horse, beneath the acacia trees in the yard. He had a big scar on his 
face, apparently
                  the result of a collision with a tree; and seemed 
poverty-stricken enough to disarm hostility. Obviously, he was "down on
                  his luck." He looked very thin and sickly, with 
clothes ragged and boots broken. Had it not been for that indefinable 
self-reliant
                  look which drovers—the Ishmaels of the bush—always 
acquire, one might have taken him for a swagman. His horse was in much
                  the same plight. A ragged, unkempt pony, pitifully 
poor and very footsore—at first sight, an absolute "moke," but a second
                  glance showed colossal round ribs, square hips, and a 
great length of rein, the rest hidden<span class="pb"> [PAGE 220] </span>beneath
 a wealth of loose hair. He looked like "a good journey horse," possibly
 something better.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">We gathered round while M'Gregor 
questioned the drover. The man was monosyllabic to a degree, as real 
bushmen generally are.
                  It is only the rowdy and the town-bushy that are 
fluent of speech.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Good morrning," said M'Gregor.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Mornin', boss," said the drover, 
shortly.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Is this the horrse ye have for sale?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yes."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Aye," and M'Gregor looked at the pony 
with a business-like don't-think-much-of-him air; ran his hand lightly 
over the hard
                  legs, and opened the passive creature's mouth. "H'm," 
he said. Then he turned to the drover. "Ye seem a bit oot o' luck. Ye're
                  thin like. What's been the matter?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Been sick with fever—Queensland fever.
 Just come through from the North. Been out on the Diamantina last."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Aye. I was there mysel'," said 
M'Gregor. "Have ye the fever on ye still?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yes—goin' home to get rid of it."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">It should be explained that a man can 
only get Queensland fever in a malarial district, but he can carry it 
with him wherever
                  he goes. If he stays, it will sap all his strength and
 pull him to pieces; if he moves to a better climate, the malady moves
                  with him, leaving him only by degrees, and coming back
 at regular intervals to rack, shake, burn, and sweat its victim. 
Queensland
                  fever will pull a man down from fifteen stone to nine 
stone faster, and with greater certainty, than any system of dosing
                  yet invented. Gradually it wears itself out, often 
wearing its patient out at the same time. M'Gregor had been through the
                  experience, and there was a slight change in his voice
 as he went on with the palaver.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Where are ye makin' for the noo?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Monaro—my people live in Monaro."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"How will ye get to Monaro if ye sell 
the horrse?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Coach and rail. Too sick to care about
 ridin'," said the<span class="pb"> [PAGE 221] </span>drover, while a 
wan smile flitted over his yellow-grey features. "I've rode him far 
enough. I've rode that horse a thousand
                  miles I would n't sell him, only I'm a bit hard up. 
Sellin' him now to get the money to go home."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"How old is he?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Seven."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Is he a good horse on a camp?" asked 
M'Gregor.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No better camp horse in Queensland," 
said the drover. "You can chuck the reins on his neck, an' he'll cut out
 a beast by
                  himself."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">M'Gregor's action in this matter 
puzzled us. We spent our time crawling after sheep, and a camp horse 
would be about as much
                  use to us as side-pockets to a pig. We had expected 
Sandy to rush the fellow off the place at once, and we could n't 
understand
                  how it was that he took so much interest in him. 
Perhaps the fever-racked drover and the old camp horse appealed to him 
in
                  a way to us incomprehensible. We had never been on the
 Queensland cattle-camps, nor shaken and shivered with the fever, nor
                  lived the roving life of the overlanders. M'Gregor had
 done all this, and his heart (I can see it all now) went out to the
                  man who brought the old days back to him.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Ah, weel," he said, "we ha'e na much 
use for a camp horrse here, ye ken; wi'oot some of these lads wad like 
to try theer
                  han' cuttin' oot the milkers' cawves frae their 
mithers." And the old man laughed contemptuously, while we felt humbled 
and
                  depraved in the eyes of the man from far back. "An' 
what'll ye be wantin' for him?" asked M'Gregor.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Reckon he's worth fifteen notes," said
 the drover.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">This fairly staggered us. Our estimates
 had varied between thirty shillings and a fiver. We thought the 
negotiations would
                  close abruptly; but M'Gregor, after a little more 
examination, agreed to give the price, provided the saddle and bridle, 
both
                  grand specimens of ancient art, were given in. This 
was agreed to, and the driver was sent off to get his meals in the hut
                  before leaving by the coach.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 222] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">"The mon is verra hard-up, an' it's a 
air thing that Queensland fever,"—was the only remark that M'Gregor 
made. But we knew
                  that there was a soft spot in his heart somewhere.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">And so, next morning, the drover got a 
crisp-looking cheque, and departed by coach. He said no word while the 
cheque was being
                  written; but as he was going away the horse happened 
to be in the yard, and he went over to the old comrade that had carried
                  him so many miles, and laid a hand on his neck. "He 
ain't much to look at," said the drover, speaking slowly and awkwardly,
                  "but he's white when he's wanted." And just before the
 coach rattled off, the man of few words leant down from the box and
                  nodded impressively, "Yes, he's white when he's 
wanted."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">We didn't trouble to give the new horse
 a name. Station horses are generally called after the man from whom 
they are bought.
                  "Tom Devine," "The Regan mare," "Black M'Carthy," and 
"Bay M'Carthy" were amongst the appellations of our horses at that time.
                  As we didn't know the drover's name, we simply called 
the animal "The new horse" until a still newer horse was one day 
acquired.
                  Then, one of the hands being told to take the new 
horse, said, "D'yer mean the <i>new</i> new horse, or the <i>old</i> new
 horse?" "No," said the boss, "not the new horse—that bay horse we 
bought from the drover. The one he said was white when
                  he was wanted."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">And so, by degrees, the animal came to 
be referred to as the horse that's white when he's wanted, and at last 
settled down
                  to the definite name of "White-when-he's-wanted."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">White-when-he's-wanted didn't seem much
 of an acquisition. He was sent out to do slavery for Greenhide Billy, a
 boundary-rider
                  who plumed himself on having once been a cattle-man. 
After a week's experience of "White," Billy came in to the homestead
                  disgusted—the pony was so lazy that he had to build a 
fire under him to get him to move, and so rough that it would make a
                  man's<span class="pb"> [PAGE 223] </span>nose bleed to
 ride him more than a mile. "The boss must have been off his head to 
give fifteen notes for such a cow."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">M'Gregor heard this complaint. "Verra 
weel, Mr. Billy," said he, hotly, "ye can just tak' one of the young 
horrses in yon
                  paddock, an' if he bucks wi' ye, an' kills ye, it's 
yer ain fault. Ye're a cattle-man—so ye say—dommed if ah believe it. Ah
                  believe ye're a dairy-farmin' body frae Illawarra. Ye 
don't know neither horrse nor cattle. Mony's the time ye never rode
                  buck-jumpers, Mr. Billy!"—and with this parting shot 
the old man turned into the house, and White-when-he's-wanted came back
                  to the head station.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">For a while he was a sort of pariah. He
 used to yard the horses, fetch up the cows, and hunt travelling sheep 
through the
                  run. He really was lazy and rough; and we all decided 
that Billy's opinion of him was correct, until the day came to make
                  one of our periodical raids on the wild horses in the 
hills at the back of the run. Every now and again we formed parties
                  to run-in some of these animals; and, after nearly 
galloping to death half-a-dozen good horses, we would capture three or
                  four brumbies, and bring them in triumph to the 
homestead. These we would break-in; and, by the time they had thrown 
half
                  the crack riders on the station, broken all the 
bridles, rolled on all the saddles, and kicked all the dogs, they would 
be
                  marketable (and no great bargains) at about thirty 
shillings a head.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Yet there is no sport in the world to 
be mentioned in the same volume as "running horses"; and we were very 
keen on it. All
                  the crack nags were got as fit as possible, and fed-up
 beforehand; and on this particular occasion White-when-he's-wanted,
                  being in good trim, was given a week's hard-feed and 
lent to a harum-scarum fellow from the Upper Murray, who happened to
                  be working in a survey-camp on the run. How he did 
open our eyes! He ran the mob from hill to hill, from range to range, 
across
                  open country and back again to the hills, over flats 
and gullies, through hop-scrub and stringybark ridges; and all the time
                  White-when-he's-wanted was on the wing of the mob, 
pulling double. The mares and foals dropped out; then the colts and 
young
                  stock pulled up deadbeat;<span class="pb"> [PAGE 224] </span>and
 only the seasoned veterans of the mob were left. Most of our horses 
caved in altogether; one or two were kept in the hunt
                  by judicious nursing and shirking the work, but 
White-when-he's-wanted was with the quarry from end to end of the run, 
doing
                  double his share; and at the finish, when a chance 
offered to wheel them into the trapyard, he simply smothered them for 
pace,
                  and slewed them into the wings before they knew where 
they were. Such a capture had not fallen to our lot for many a day,
                  and the fame of White-when-he's-wanted was speedily 
noised abroad.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He was always fit for work, always 
hungry, always ready to lie down and roll, and always lazy. But when he 
heard the rush
                  of the brumbies' feet in the scrub, he became frantic 
with excitement. He could race over the roughest ground without 
misplacing
                  a hoof or altering his stride, and he could sail over 
fallen timber and across gullies like a kangaroo. Nearly every Sunday
                  we were after the brumbies, until they got as lean as 
greyhounds and as cunning as policemen. We were always ready to back
                  White-when-he's-wanted to run-down, single-handed, any
 animal in the bush that we liked to put him after—wild horses, wild
                  cattle, kangaroos, emus, dingoes, kangaroo-rats—we 
barred nothing, for, if he couldn't beat them for pace, he would outlast
                  them.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">And then one day he disappeared from 
the paddock, and we never saw him again. We knew there were plenty of 
men in the district
                  who would steal him; but, as we knew also that there 
were plenty more who would "inform" for a pound or two, we were sure
                  that it could not have been the local "talent" who had
 taken him. We offered good rewards and set some of the right sort to
                  work; but we heard nothing of him for about a year.

               <p class="normal">Then the surveyor's assistant turned up
 again, after a trip to the interior. He told us the usual string of 
backblock lies,
                  and wound-up by saying that out on the very fringe of 
settlement he had met an old acquaintance.

his forehead. Came

 Tramp.</h4>
               Barbara Baynton
               
               <p class="noindent">SHE laid the stick and her baby on 
the grass while she untied the rope that tethered the calf. The length 
of the rope separated
                  them. The cow was near the calf, and both were lying 
down. Every day she found a fresh place to tether it—since tether it
                  she must, for there was no one to go after it but 
herself. She had plenty of time, but then there was baby; and if the cow
                  turned on her out on the plains, and she with baby—— 
She was afraid of the cow; she had been a town girl, only she did not
                  want the cow to know it. She used to run at first when
 the cow bellowed its protest against the penning-up of its calf. This
                  suited the cow, also the calf, but the woman's husband
 was wroth, and called her—the noun was cur. It was he who forced her
                  to run and meet the advancing cow, brandishing a stick
 and uttering threatening words till the enemy turned tail and ran 
"That's
                  the way!" the man said, laughing at her white face. In
 many things he was worse than the cow, and she wondered if the same
                  rule would apply to the man, but she was not one to 
provoke skirmishes, even with the cow.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">It was early for the calf to go "to 
bed"—nearly an hour earlier than usual; but she felt so weirdly lonely. 
Partly because
                  it was Monday, and her husband had been home for 
Saturday night and Sunday. He had gone off before daylight this morning;
                  he was a shearer, and fifteen miles as the crow flies 
separated them. She knew of no one nearer, unless the tramp. Ah! that
                  was why she had penned the calf up so early. She 
feared more from the look of his eyes, and the gleam of his teeth, as he
                  watched her newly-awakened baby beat its impatient 
fists upon her covered breasts, than from the knife that was sheathed in
                  the belt at his waist.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 227] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">Her husband, she had told him, was 
sick. She always said that when she was alone and a tramp came—and she 
had gone in from
                  the kitchen to the bedroom and asked questions and 
replied to them in the best man's voice she could assume. But this tramp
                  had walked round and round the house, and there were 
cracks in some places,—and after the last time he had asked for tobacco.
                  She had none to give, and he had grinned, because 
there was a broken clay pipe near the wood-heap where he stood, and if 
there
                  were a man inside there ought to have been tobacco. 
Then he asked for money, but women in the bush never have money.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">At last he was gone, and she, watching 
through the cracks inside, saw him when about a quarter of a mile away 
turn and look
                  back at the house. Then he went further in the 
direction that she would have him go; but he paused again, turned and 
looked
                  behind him, and, apparently satisfied, moved to the 
left towards the creek. The creek made a bow round the house, and when
                  he came to it she lost sight of him. Hours after, 
watching intently in that direction for signs of smoke, she saw the 
man's
                  dog chasing some sheep that had gone to the creek for 
water, and saw it slink back suddenly, as if the man had called it.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">More than once she thought of taking 
her baby and going to her husband, but as yet she had not set her will 
against his as
                  with the cow, and so dared not. Long before nightfall 
she placed food in the kitchen, and a big brooch that had been her 
mother's
                  she put upon the table, because, if the man did come 
back and robbery were his object, it was the only thing valuable that
                  she had. And she left the kitchen door open—wide open;
 but this was not wise.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">How she fastened the doors inside! 
Beside the bolt in the back one she drove in the steel and the scissors;
 against it she
                  piled the stools and the table. Beside the lock on the
 front door she forced the handle of the spade, under the middle bar,
                  and the blade between the cracks in the flooring 
boards. Then the prop-stick, cut into lengths, held the top as the spade
                  held the middle. The windows were little more than 
port-holes; she had nothing to fear through them.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 228] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">She ate a few mouthfuls of food and 
drank a cup of cold milk, for she lighted no fire, and when night came 
no candle, but
                  crept with her baby to bed.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">What woke her? The wonder was that she 
had slept: she had not meant to, but she was young, very young. Perhaps 
the shrinking
                  of the galvanised roof—yet hardly, that was too usual.
 Something had set her heart beating wildly, and the very air she 
breathed
                  seemed fraught with terrible danger, but she lay quite
 still—only she put her other arm over her baby. Then she had both round
                  it, and she prayed: "Little baby—little baby—don't 
wake!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She saw one of the open cracks, quite 
close to where she lay, darken with a shadow—for the moon's rays shone 
on that side.
                  Then a protesting growl reached her; and she could 
fancy she heard the man turn hastily: she plainly heard the thud of 
something
                  striking the dog's ribs, and the long, flying strides 
of the animal as it howled and ran. Still watching, she saw the shadow
                  darken every crack along the wall: she knew by the 
sounds that the man was trying every position that might help him to see
                  in; but how much he saw she could not tell. She 
thought of doing many things that might deceive him into the idea that 
she
                  was not alone, but the sound of her voice would wake 
baby, and, as though that were the only danger that threatened her, she
                  dreaded it. If baby cried she felt as if she, in turn,
 must betray her weakness, and instinctively cry to her protector, 
fifteen
                  miles away. So she prayed: "Little baby, don't wake! 
don't cry!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Very stealthily the man crept about. 
She knew he had his boots off, because of the vibration that his feet 
caused as he walked
                  along the verandah, gauging the width of the little 
window in her room and the resistance of the front door. Then he went
                  to the other end, and the uncertainty of what he might
 be doing was fearful: she had felt safer, far safer, while he was 
close,
                  and she could watch and listen. But now! Oh, God! it 
was terrible. She felt she must watch, and again the great fear of 
wakening
                  baby assailed her. And there was another thing: on 
that side of the house one<span class="pb"> [PAGE 229] </span>of the 
slabs had shrunk in length as well as in width, and had once fallen out.
 It was held in position only by a wedge of
                  wood underneath. What if he should discover that! The 
uncertainty increased her terror. She felt she must rise: and now, how
                  she prayed as she gently raised herself with her 
little one in her arms, held tightly to her breast!
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The vital parts in her child's body she
 tried to shield with her hands and arms as she thought of the knife: 
even its little
                  feet she covered with its white gown, and baby never 
murmured—it liked to be held so. Noiselessly she crossed to the other
                  side, and stood where she could see and hear, but not 
be seen. He was trying every slab, and was very near to that with the
                  wedge under it. Then, even while hoping, she saw him 
find it; and heard the sound of the knife as bit by bit he began to cut
                  away the wooden barrier.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She waited still, with her baby pressed
 tightly to her; though she knew that in another few minutes this man 
with the cruel
                  eyes, lascivious mouth and gleaming knife would be 
able to enter. One side of the slab tilted; there was nothing to do now
                  but cut away the remaining little end, when the slab, 
unless he held it, would fall inside or out; and then——
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">She heard his jerked breathing as it 
kept time with the cuts of the knife, and heard the brush of his clothes
 as they rubbed
                  the walls with his movements, for she was so still and
 quiet that she did not even tremble. And she knew when he ceased, and
                  wondered why. She stood well concealed; she knew he 
could not see her and that he would not fear if he did; yet she heard
                  him move cautiously away. Perhaps he expected the slab
 to fall. Still, his motive puzzled her; his retreat was a pretence,
                  she felt sure; and she moved even closer and bent her 
body the better to listen. Ah! what sound was that? "Listen! Listen!"
                  she bade her heart—her heart that had kept so still 
hitherto, but now bounded with tumultuous throbs that dulled her ears.
                  Nearer and nearer came the sounds, till the welcome 
thud of horse's hoofs rang out clearly.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!" she cried;
 for they were very close before she could make sure, and then there was
 the door<span class="pb"> [PAGE 230] </span>so locked and barred with 
many bars. The age it took to tear away its fastenings!
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Out she darted at last, and, tearing 
madly along, saw the horseman far beyond her in the distance. She called
 to him in Christ's
                  name, in her babe's name, still flying like the wind 
with the speed that deadly peril sends; but the distance grew greater
                  and greater between them, and when she reached the 
creek her prayers turned to wild shrieks, for there crouched the man she
                  feared, with out-stretched hands that had caught her 
ere she saw him. She knew he was offering terms if she ceased to 
struggle
                  and cry for help, though louder and louder did she cry
 for it; but it was only when the man's hand gripped her throat that
                  the cry of "Murder!" came from her lips; and when she 
fell the startled curlews took up the awful sound, and flew over the
                  horseman's head shrieking "M-u-r-d-e-r! M-u-r-d-e-r! 
M-u-r-d-e-r!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"By God!" said the boundary-rider, 
"it's been a dingo right enough. Eight killed up here, and there's more 
down in the creek
                  —a ewe and lamb, I'll bet; and the lamb's alive." And 
he shut out the sky with his hand and watched the crows that were 
circling
                  round and round, nearing the earth one moment and the 
next shooting skyward. By that he knew the lamb must be alive. Even
                  a dingo will spare a lamb sometimes.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Yes, the lamb was alive, and after the 
manner of lambs of its age did not know its mother when the light came. 
It had sucked
                  the still-warm breasts and laid its little head on her
 bosom and slept till morn; then, when the wee one looked at the 
swollen,
                  disfigured face with the starting eyes, and clenched 
teeth that had bitten through the tongue and stained the bodice crimson,
                  it wept and would have crept away but for the hand 
that still clutched its little gown. Sleep was nodding its golden head
                  and swaying its small body, and the crows were close, 
so close, to the other's wide-open eyes, when the boundary-rider 
galloped
                  down. He reeled in his saddle when he saw the two, 
and, covering his eyes, cried, "Jesus Christ!" And he told afterwards 
how
                  the little child held<span class="pb"> [PAGE 231] </span>out
 its arms to him, and how he was forced to cut the portion of its gown 
that the dead hand held.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">A few miles further down the creek a 
man kept throwing an old cap into the water. The dog would bring it out 
and lay it on
                  the opposite side from where the man stood, but would 
not allow the man to catch him, though it was only to wash the blood
                  of the sheep from his mouth and throat, for the sight 
of blood made the man tremble.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">But the dog also was guilty.</p>

               <p class="noindent">IT had rained steadily for three 
days, and all hands were gathered round the cook-house fire—the only 
decently-dry place in
                  camp. Dead sick we were of loafing and playing euchre 
for matches. Talk turned upon a recent discovery of moa-bones down 
south,
                  and, of course, old Dick took the lead. There wasn't a
 mortal thing on earth that he didn't know something about. He had been
                  sailor, miner, soldier, bushman, and the Lord knows 
what else; and, though he was past sixty, he could handle a hook or a
                  flail with the best of us.

               <p class="normal">"Yes, mates, it can't have been very 
long since the last moa turned up its toes. In fact, I could spin a yarn
 'bout that very
                  same bird, only I don't care to be thought a liar by 
any man."

               <p class="normal">"Let her go, Gallagher! let her go!" 
was the chorus all round.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"We'd believe you, Dick," added a 
Taranaki man, "if you told us you had shorn Esau, the hairy man, and 
sold his fleece to
                  St. Peter for a door-mat."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">——"Came out here," went on Dick without
 more ado, "in the early days, when the West Coast was just beginning to
 boom. Self
                  and mate cleared out from the barque we were on at 
Lyttleton, and made 'cross country to the Coast. We had a pretty rough
                  time at first, and went back past all the other 
diggers, after a bit, and camped in the bottom of a big gorge. Here we 
made
                  very fair money, even for those days, although we were
 pretty lonesome all by ourselves. First night or two we got devilish
                  well scared. Just about dark there would come a wild, 
wailin' sort o' noise, something like a steam-siren in a fog. But, as
                  nothin' happened, we soon got used to that; in fact, 
we used it as a kind o' tea-bell.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"However, one day we was workin' on a 
bit of terrace at the<span class="pb"> [PAGE 233] </span>bottom of the 
gorge, when a boulder, the size of a man's head, came out of the bush 
above us as if it had been fired from
                  a cannon; then came two or three more, and then a 
six-foot log, and we reckoned it wasn't healthy where little things like
                  that were flyin' round, so we knocked off and went up 
to see what the trouble was. We climbed up to a little terrace 'bout
                  fifty yards above us, and there was the chap that had 
done it!—a thunderin' big bird, 'bout twice the size of an ostrich.
                  He was scratching for dear life, just like a rooster, 
an' every now an' again he would pick up a worm or a grub. 'Poor 
beggar!'
                  says Jack; 'if he has to load-up with that sort o' 
tack he'll be a long time gettin' his full cargo on board.'
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"We looked at him and he looked at us, 
and just went on scratching again; so we concluded to let well alone.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"After that we often used to meet the 
beggar stalking about the river-bed or in the bush; in fact, he seemed 
to like to see
                  us. S'pose he felt a bit lonely with none of his mates
 about. What was he like? Well, not unlike one of them wood-hens you
                  see running about, only about a thousand times as big.
 He had little bits of wings, an' a funny little tail that he stuck
                  up in a comical way, every step he took. Run!—by the 
hokey, he could run! Saw him chasing a Maori-rat one day, and the rat
                  hadn't a show. Our friend just put down his head and 
went through the scrub and supple-jacks like greased lightnin'.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"At last one night the beggar paid us a
 visit in camp, just as we were sitting down to tea. S'pose the grubs 
and worms had
                  been a bit scarce that day, for he seemed pretty sharp
 set. Jack threw him half a roast pigeon; he swallowed it like a pea,
                  and then the fun began. He walked right up to the 
tent-door, and began to tackle the rest of the grub. Jack up and hit him
                  with a pick-handle, but the bloomin' dicky-bird just 
planted his foot in Jack's chest, and Jack sat down mighty quick. Then
                  I chimed in with a tomahawk, but he just let me have 
one-two in such short order that I thought I might as well have a spell,
                  too. He was a good doer, and no mistake! Scoffed our 
pigeons whole, choked over the damper, swallowed a knife, an' then he
                  put his beak in the hot tea.<span class="pb"> [PAGE 
234] </span>Pulls it back pretty sudden, you bet! but when Jack gives a 
chuckle and raises his head a bit where he is lyin', the old fowl
                  just steps over to him and dances all the grinnin' out
 of him in two jiffs. Back he goes, then, and starts to turn out the
                  whole bloomin' caboose. Finding the tent a bit awkward
 for a bird of his size, he just kicks it to Jericho an' starts 
scratchin'
                  like a steam-engine. My word! the way those things did
 fly! He found my watch and swallowed it, leavin' the chain hangin'
                  out of his beak. Then he got on to some tinned stuff, 
an' down went the two-pound tins like pills. But drink was his ruin—like
                  many another's!
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"We had some rum in the bottom of a 
long tin-can, and when he shoved his beak into this I suppose he found 
it pretty good;
                  at all events he wasn't in a hurry to take his beak 
out again. When he did try to get out, the handle of the tin stuck round
                  his neck, and there he was blindfolded. Things began 
to fly worse than ever then; he went dancing round into the fire and
                  up again' the trees till he found it wouldn't come off
 that way, so he quietened down—put the tin on the ground, and started
                  working it off gradually. This was our chance! I ups 
with the tomahawk and takes the can fairly off for him; of course it
                  wasn't my fault that his head came with it!
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Well, boys, we lived on that bird for 
nearly a month; he was something like turkey, with a dash of shag. Yes; 
we got the
                  tinned-meat and the watch out all right; likewise 
about fifty quid worth of rough gold that the beggar had stowed away. 
Why
                  didn't we take the carcase into town? Because we were 
new-chums, my lad, an' didn't know but moas was as common as 
cock-a-doodles."

 The Log of the Outward Bound.</h4>
               J. H. Greene
               
               <p class="noindent">THE look-out had sighted some 
wreckage on the lee-quarter; the mate, aloft, had made out a ship's mast
 in the centre of the
                  circular vista his binocular gave him; and the 
steamer's head fell off three points to leeward so as to pass closer. 
The stale
                  novels and quoits, the staler flirtations, were 
dropped, and all the passengers crowded to the side; except the 
half-dozen
                  men in the smoking-room, who still kept to their 
eternal poker. The rest waited, glancing alternately from the sea to the
                  cross-trees, and looking where pointed the black 
barrels of the mate's glasses.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"There's a man lashed to it!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The cry from aloft sent a thrill of 
excitement all through the steamer. Down to the sick people, who tried 
to come on deck,
                  or at least rolled over in their bunks to open their 
dead-lights; down to the engineers, reaching with oil-cans between 
flying
                  piston-rods; down past the grimy, sweating devils in 
the stokehole, till it got into the coal, mingled with the steam, and
                  flew through the pipes and valves like spirit through 
the veins of a man. But the poker-players remained calm.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Tell us when we come up," said one who
 held four aces. "Raise you five pounds!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The smoke tumbled from the funnels with
 a hoarse roar; the minutes seemed as many as the countless waves that 
one by one dashed
                  against the bow, and fell by, broken and shattered, 
into the hissing wake. Then the spar was sighted from the deck; bit by
                  bit the details became plainer,—the top, the 
dishevelled rigging, and something else—a mere spot—which gradually grew
 into
                  the bare breast of a man, in blue trousers, lashed 
with many coils to the mast.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 236] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">Steam was stopped and a boat lowered. 
There was no sign of life from the castaway; he hung forward limply on 
his lashings,
                  and he seemed fearfully wasted. Coming closer, a 
slight movement of his head was seen, but it was only the rocking of the
                  sea, and it added to his helpless, dead appearance. 
Rough hands grew womanly as they cut him loose and laid him in the 
stern.
                  Then the boat shot back to the steamer, whose black 
sides were spotted with little white specks along the bulwarks and at
                  every cabin-window.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Living—just!" said the doctor, from 
the sheets, as the boat touched the side. There was a cheer, in which 
even the poker-players
                  joined, with their hands in their pockets clutching 
the last deal.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then the fearfully light armful was 
lifted on board, and left to the doctor forward; the steamer was put on 
her course; and
                  the forlorn spar, with its tangle of rigging, was soon
 bobbing away in the white wake that she trailed behind her half-way
                  round the world.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The passengers would have liked the man
 to relate his adventures, but no one had seen him except the doctor, 
whose bulletin
                  said that he was very weak, hardly sensible, and an 
almost hopeless case. On the evening of the third day, when the 
subject—considered
                  as a topic for the saloon—had so waned in interest 
that bets were no longer made as to the patient's living or not, the 
doctor
                  came to the captain.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"He's sensible now, and he wants to see
 you—to make a statement, he says."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Is he ——?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Umph—yes! I'm afraid so."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">They went forward to the sick bay, 
where the lamps, switched low, showed a man lying back, with sunken 
temples, and cheeks
                  gaunt and hollow under the new beard that half-covered
 them. He turned a glance, glittering with death, upon the comers, and
                  spoke in a struggling whisper.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Skipper, my clearance is made out. I 
want my wife to know at once that I am dead—you're a liner, ain't 
you—that's good! the<span class="pb"> [PAGE 237] </span>news'll be 
quicker. I don't want no 'missin' at Lloyd's,' and waitin' and waitin' 
month arter month for me to turn up. 'Tain't
                  good for a woman, 'specially when—oh! it's mighty 
hard, skipper! —we was only just married, but it's better she knows at 
once—the
                  oncertainty'd kill her, and she'll be able to bear it 
better now than —than if it come on her by-and-by. Tell her immediate,
                  skipper; and tell the owners that the Laura May has 
foundered, so Jenny can get my wages; she'll want it, poor girl."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The captain assured him, and he went 
on:</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"My name's Trigg—Benjamin Trigg, A.B., 
of the Laura May, barquentine, of Liverpool, homeward bound from Port 
Royal with logwood—fifteen
                  souls, all told—all gone but me! ... God Almighty! 
there they are again! Keep 'em off! Keep 'em off!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">It was only a cockroach that had 
dropped on the blanket, but he had risen on one elbow with the 
miraculous strength of delirium,
                  and his whole frame trembled with horror.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Not like that! Oh, God! don't kill me 
like poor Joe! No, no, God!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He seemed to sweep something off his 
face, and fell back suddenly in collapse. The doctor flicked the insect 
away.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Gone?" asked the captain.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yes."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Poor devil! What did he mean? Sounded 
like the horrors, did n't it?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No, it can't be that—it's very 
peculiar—the sun has got at his brain."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You're—right—doctor—it ain't." The 
man's eyes were still closed, but his lips parted in an almost inaudible
 whisper.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Alive!" started the two listeners.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Ay—I'm alive—summat, and it ain't the 
'orrors. They ain't so bad as hanging over that deck hearin' Joe and 
watchin' them
                  crawlin' things. You'll keep 'em off me, won't yer, 
doctor—you won't let me die like my poor messmate? ... Gimme something 
and
                  I'll tell ye about it."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The doctor, still perplexed, leant over
 the castaway, quietly<span class="pb"> [PAGE 238] </span>parting down 
the clasped, beseeching hands, and holding the brandy to the blackened 
lips.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Thank ye—that's better—I'll get 
along—'s nearly high water. It happened tenth day out. We'd been 
becalmed three days, and
                  it was the rollin' about in the blazin' sun with the 
sea lukewarm that did it. There was millions and millions of eggs in
                  that blasted stuff, and the sun hatched 'em. ... 
Skipper, what's your cargo?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"General merchandise."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Any logwood?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"That's right. Steer clear of it. 'Cos 
when you're becalmed the sun hatches them things—never open the hatches 
when you're

               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"This is a steamer, my man," said the 
captain.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I know—can't I hear yer 
engines—they're sayin' I'm dead, so Jenny'll get my wages. <i>I'm-dead-that-I-am-that-I-am-that-I-am</i>
 —listen, skipper!—<i>I'm dead</i>—they speak quite plain—<i>that-I-am-that-I-am-that</i>——

               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Lord, old girl, who'd 'a' thought 
you'd 'a' made so much out o' washin' shirts—Mrs. Trigg, Laundress—I 
painted the same sort
                  of curly L on the bows of the Laura May—don't pipe yer
 eye, I'm home now, and I'll never sail on a logwood ship no more. 
Tighter,

Wha-at! God's mercy! yer don't say so? Bless yer, lass—and him or her,

               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He went off into disconnected scraps of
 sentences, each in a different voice, and then into inarticulate 
mutterings. Even
                  when he was silent the diseased activity of his brain 
was shown by the voiceless thought that ran in rapid changes of 
expression
                  over his face. The two men tried hard to gather its 
import; then the<span class="pb"> [PAGE 239] </span>captain whispered to
 the doctor, who shook his head doubtfully and said, "I don't think it's
 any use."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I do," said the captain. "I've seen it
 before; it'll bring him up with a round turn."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then in his quarter-deck voice he 
shouted, "Ready about—stand by!" right in the sailor's ear, who at once 
ceased his vague
                  muttering and answered, "Ay, ay, sir!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"See!" whispered the captain, "look at 
his hands! he's unhitched the braces—all but a turn. Now we can lead 
him. Trigg!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Ay, ay, sir!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What happened when the Laura May was 
on the homeward voyage?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The man went on in a low, weakening 
voice that at times died away to nothing, but each time he wandered the 
captain brought
                  him back by a call to duty and a question.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"The skipper thought we'd sprung a leak
 through strainin' of the timbers, and he ordered us to take off the 
'atches. I was
                  for'ard when I heard a scream—like a woman's—and I ran
 aft and saw everybody runnin' away from the 'atches, 'cos the inside
                  of the 'old was one infernal crawlin' mass of 
insects—lizards, and scorpions, and centipedes, and beetles, and things I
 never
                  before heard tell on, and millions and millions of 
ants, white and black and red, all hatched out of the logwood. And there
                  was Joe Deebles, my messmate, dancin' about howlin', 
'cos one o' them things had bit him. In half an eye we was racin' aloft,
                  'cos the pesky things was spreadin' fore and aft as if
 we had shipped a sea of 'em. We was real downright frightened, and
                  all the time Joe was doublin' up of himself in the 
maintop, and his leg was all blue and swollen like a poisoned pup. And
                  the insects was tumblin' out of the 'old like mad, and
 soon there was n't an inch clear of 'em. At first the mate tried to
                  fight 'em with a mop on the poop, but some of the 
durned things could jump, and towards afternoon there was flyin' things
                  as well, with nasty red wings, buzzin' above the deck.
 I was with Joe in the maintop, and the rest was scattered 
permiscus-like
                  all over the riggin'. We was all fearfully thirsty; it
 was blazing hot, and<span class="pb"> [PAGE 240] </span>all the while 
them leggy things was knottin' and splicin' of themselves below. We was 
afraid they'd come aloft, but when they
                  sniffed the bulwarks, which was bubblin' tar, they 
'bouted ship back again. We saw the ants run up the railin's, and round
                  the wheel and all over the spokes, all fightin' and 
scruffin'. They swarmed over the binnacle, and some long things slipped
                  back on the eaves, and fell flat on the deck with 
their white bellies up, and their dozens o' legs kickin' in the air. And
                  we heard a screech from Neil Hansen's parrot in the 
fo'c's'le, and we knew they'd got at it. It was as much as we could do
                  to stop Neil from goin' down to save it. Then the 
skipper's fox-terrier began to sniff and yowl under the door, and the 
crawlers
                  must've got him, for we heard him snappin' and howlin'
 and dancin' round till he, too, was quiet. We knew that the things'd
                  never be got out of the ship, and the skipper talked 
of burnin' her. And there was a nasty insecty smell which was sickening;
                  it came mostly from the caboose, which was smokin', 
and it was mixed up with pea-soup. The things must've fallen into the
                  fire. And Joe was gettin' weaker and weaker, and 
talkin' of home, so we had to bind him to the ratlines. Now and again 
someone'd
                  go aloft to the truck, but there was never nothin' in 
sight. Then night came on, and the first few hours afore the moon rose
                  was awful up there in the dark with Joe dyin', and the
 creep, creep, creep of them things below. Every minute you'd hear 
somebody
                  startin' o' slappin' hisself, as if he felt somethin' 
crawlin up him. When the moon rose it was better, 'cos we could see
                  each other, and the skipper started a song to liven 
us, sayin' we was in the track of steamers, and we'd sure to be sighted.
                  All of a sudden Joe joined in the chorus, very loud, 
and afore a man could say 'Avast' he'd broken loose his lashin's and
                  jumped off the top. He went singin' all the way down, 
till we heard him scrunch into the insects on deck. We just see'd his
                  face for a minute, all white in the moonlight, and 
them cursed things closed over him, and he was only a heap of insects

 Our Selection.</h4>
               Arthur H. Davis (Steele Rudd)
               
               <p class="noindent">THE baby, twelve months old, was to 
be christened, and Mother decided to give a party. She had been thinking
 about the party
                  for some time; but decision was contemporaneous with 
the arrival of a certain mysterious parcel, when we were told to prepare
                  for the party in earnest.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Dad and Dave were drawing water. Joe 
was raking husks and corn-cobs into a heap at the door and burning them.
 Little Bill
                  was collecting the pumpkins and pie-melons strewn 
about the yard. Mother and Sal were engaged outside. Mother stood on a 
box;
                  Sal spread newspapers on the table and smeared them 
over with paste, then handed them cautiously to mother, who fixed them
                  on the wall. The baby crawled upon the floor.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Not that way," said mother; "that's 
upside-down; give them to me straight, 'cause your father sometimes 
likes to read them
                  when they're up."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">They chatted about the christening.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Indeed, then, she won't be asked," Sal
 said; "not if she goes down on her knees—th' skinny little——"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Min', min', <i>mind,</i> girl!" Mother
 screeched; and Sal dropped the newspaper she was about to hand up, and 
jumping a stool caught the baby by the
                  skirt-tail just as it was about to wobble into the 
fire.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"My goodness! you little <i>rat!</i>" 
The baby laughed playfully, and struggled to get out of her arms. Sal 
placed it at the opposite side of the room, and the
                  decorating continued.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I can remember the time, then," Mother
 said, "when they had n't so much to be flash about; when the old woman 
and that eldest
                  girl, Johanna, used to go about in their bare feet<span
 class="pb"> [PAGE 243] </span>and with dresses on—dear me!—that I 
wouldn't give to a blackgin!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Not Johanna, mother!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yes, <i>Johanna;</i> you wouldn't 
remember it, of course; Norah was the baby then."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You little wretch!" and Sal rushed for
 the baby and pulled it from the fire once more. She dumped it down in a
 different
                  corner, and returned to the paste. The baby made 
eagerly for the fire again, but when half-way across the room it 
stopped,
                  rested its cheek on the floor and fell asleep—and it 
on the verge of being christened "Bartholomew!"—until Dad came in and
                  took it up.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Mother went into her bedroom and came 
out with a flaring red sash flying over her greasy gown, and asked Dad 
if he liked it.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Dad looked at the ribbon, then out of 
the window and chuckled.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What d'y' think of me?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"<i>Think</i> of y'?"—and Dad grinned.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Mother looked fondly at the ribbon. She
 was very satisfied with herself. She was a true woman. She tripped into
 the room again
                  and came out with some yards of print, and asked Dad 
what he thought of <i>that</i>. Mother was fond of dress.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Dear me, woman!" Dad said; "what's 
going to happen?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"But how do y' like it?"—letting it 
hang like a skirt.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Dad grinned more.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Is it a nice pattern?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Dad still grinned.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Does it <i>suit</i> me?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Dad looked out the window and saw Joe 
knock little Bill down with a pumpkin. He ran out.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Men haven't a bit of taste," Mother 
said to Sal, folding the print, "except just for what" (Joe rushed in at
 the front door
                  and out the back one)—"'cept for what's to go in their
 stomachs. All they think about's an old"—(Dad rushed in at the front
                  door and out the back one)—"old horse or something; 
and then they think"—(Joe rushed in again at the front door, but dived
                  under the sofa)—"think every old screw is a 
race-horse"—(Dad rushed in<span class="pb"> [PAGE 244] </span>again at 
the front door and out at the back one)—"my word! if he finds you there,
 me shaver, you'll catch it!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Joe breathed hard.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Mother put the print away and mounted 
the box again. Then Mrs. Flannigan—a glib-tongued old gossip, the mother
 of sixteen
                  shy selector children—dropped in, and they drank tea 
together and talked about christening and "matches" and marriages and
                  babies and bad times and bad husbands until dark—until
 Mrs. Flannigan thought her husband would be wanting his supper, and
                  went home.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Joe talked of the christening at 
school. For a time nobody paid any attention to him; but as days passed,
 and one and another
                  went home to find that mother and father and bigger 
brothers and sisters had been "asked," the interest grew, and a 
revulsion
                  of feeling in favour of Joe set in. First, Nell 
Anderson suddenly evinced a desire for his society—till then she would 
weep
                  if made stand next him in class; then the Murphys and 
the Browns and young Roberts surrounded him, and Reuben Burton put his
                  string bridle on him, and wouldn't ride any other 
horse in a race; and at last Joe became the idol of the institution. 
They
                  all fawned on him and followed him about—all but the 
two Caseys. They were isolated, and seemed to feel their position 
keenly.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Joe was besieged with questions, and he
 answered them with a head-shake and a sniffling of one nostril. He 
disclosed all the
                  arrangements, and gave melting descriptions of the 
pies and puddings Mother was preparing. How they danced around him and
                  called him "Joseph"! The two Caseys stood off in 
silence, and in fancy saw those pies and puddings. A pleasant 
contemplation
                  till Nell Anderson pointed to them, and asked Joe if 
they were invited.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Nah," Joe said; "n-n-none of 'em is."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Ain't their mother?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"N-nah, we d-don't want'em,"—and he 
snuffled more. The two Caseys stole away to the rear of the school, 
where they sat and
                  nursed their chagrin in lugubrious silence, and caught
 flies mechanically, and looked down at their bare feet over which the<span
 class="pb"> [PAGE 245] </span>ants crawled, until the teacher thumped 
the end of the little building with a huge paling, and school went in.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The day came, and we all rose early and
 got ready. The parson, who had to ride twenty-five miles to be present,
 arrived near
                  mid-day. His clothes were dusty, and he looked tired. 
Mother and Sal wondered if they should offer him something to eat, or
                  let him wait until the guests arrived and all sat to 
the big spread. They called Dad and Dave into the little tumble-down
                  kitchen to discuss the matter. Dad said he didn't care
 what they did; but Dave settled it. He said: "Get th' chap a feed."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Joe sat on the sofa beside the parson's
 tall hat and eyed it in wonder. Joe had never seen so much 
Respectability before.
                  The parson ate with his back turned to Joe, while 
Mother and Sal flew busily about. Joe cautiously put out his hand to 
feel
                  the beaver. Mother saw him and frowned. Joe withdrew 
his hand and stared at the rafters.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Delicious tea!" said the parson, and 
Mother served him with more.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Joe's hand stole out to the hat again. 
Dave, standing outside near the front door, noticed him and grinned. 
That emboldened
                  Joe, and he lifted the hat and placed his head inside 
it, and grinned out at Dave. Mother frowned more, but Joe couldn't see
                  her. She hurried out. Then from the back of the house 
Dad's voice thundered "<i>Joe!</i>" Joe removed the beaver and obeyed 
the call. Harsh, angry whispers came from the door, then sounds of a 
scuffle, and an empty
                  bucket flew after Joe as he raced across the yard 
towards the haystack.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Soon the guests began to arrive. The 
Maloneys and the Todds and the Taits and the Thompsons and others, with 
children and
                  dogs, came in spring-carts and drays from Back Creek; 
the Watsons and the Whites and old Holmes and Judy Jubb, from Prosperity
                  Peak, appeared on horseback. Judy, in the middle of 
the yard, stepped out of a torn and tattered old riding-habit, with 
traces
                  of the cow-yard about it, and displayed a pair of big 
boots and<span class="pb"> [PAGE 246] </span>"railway" stockings, and a 
nice white muslin dress with red bows and geraniums and a lot of frills 
and things on it. Judy
                  was very genteel. The Sylvesters—nice people that came
 from Brisbane with new ideas and settled near us; people who couldn't
                  leg-rope a cow; who were going to make a big thing out
 of fowls; who were for ever asking Dad if jew-lizards were snakes—came
                  on foot with their baby in a little painted cart. A 
large black dog, well-groomed and in new harness, without reins, pulled
                  the cart along. We had never seen a dog pulling a cart
 before—neither had our dog. He rushed off to meet the Sylvesters, but
                  stopped half-way and curled his tail over his back, 
and growled, and threw earth about with his legs. Sylvesters' dog stood
                  also, and curled <i>his</i> tail over his back. Mrs. 
Sylvester patted him and said, "<i>Carlo</i>—<i>Carlo!</i> you naughty 
boy!" Our dog suddenly made off. Sylvesters' dog pursued him. He tore 
along the fence at coursing speed, making
                  a great noise with the cart until he turned a corner, 
where the cart upset and left the baby. But he didn't catch our dog.
                  And Paddy Maloney and Steve Burton and young Wilkie 
galloped up through the paddock, shouting and whipping their horses, and
                  carried away the clothes-line stretched between two 
trees at the back.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The house soon filled—there was just 
room for big Mrs. M'Doolan to squeeze in. She came on foot, puffing and 
blowing, and
                  drank the glass of christening water that stood on the
 table with bull-frogs careering round in it. She shook hands with 
everybody
                  she knew, and with everybody she didn't know, and 
kissed the baby. There was no pride about big Mrs. M'Doolan.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The ceremony was about to commence. Joe
 and the young Todds and the young Taits, who, with the tomahawk and 
some dogs—about
                  twenty-six dogs—had been up the paddock hunting 
kangaroo-rats, returned with a live jew-lizard. They squatted round the 
door
                  guarding the trophy.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Dad and Mother, with the baby in a 
dress of rebellious hues, stood up and faced the parson. All became 
silent and expectant.
                  The parson whispered something to mother, and she 
placed the baby in Dad's great arms. The band of hunters at the door 
giggled,
                  and<span class="pb"> [PAGE 247] </span>the jew-lizard 
tried to escape. Dad, his hair and beard grown very long, stared at the 
parson with a look of wild, weird reverence
                  about him.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"In the name of the Father," the parson
 drawled, dipping his fingers into the water and letting it drip on to 
the baby's face,
                  "I baptise thee, Barthol——"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Interruption.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The jew-lizard escaped, and with open 
mouth and head up raced across the floor. Had it been a boa-constrictor 
or a bunyip
                  the women couldn't have squealed with more enthusiasm.
 It made straight for Judy Jubb. But Judy had been chased by a 
jew-lizard
                  before. She drew back her skirts—also her leg—and 
kicked the vermin in the chest and lifted it to the rafters. It fell 
behind
                  the sofa and settled on Todd's bull-dog that was 
planted there. Bully seized it and shook it vigorously and threw it 
against
                  Mrs. M'Doolan, and seized it again and shook it 
more—shook it until our dog and a pack of others rushed in. "T' th' 
devil!"
                  said Dad, indignantly, aiming heavy kicks at the 
brutes. "The <i>child</i>—gimme th' child!" Mother shrieked, pulling at 
Dad. "Out w' y'!" said Anderson, letting fly his foot. "<i>Down</i>, 
Bully!" shouted Todd, and between them all they kicked the dogs right 
through the door, then heaved the lizard after them.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">But the ceremony was soon over, and 
everybody was radiant with joy—everybody but Bartholomew. <i>He</i> had 
been asleep until the parson dropped the water on his face, when he woke
 suddenly. He glared at the strange assemblage
                  a moment, then whined and cried hard. Mother "hooshed"
 him, and danced him up and down saying, "Did they <i>fri</i>-ten 'm?" 
Mrs. M'Doolan took him and "hooshed" him and jumped him about and said: "<i>There</i>
 now—<i>there</i> now!" But Bartholomew resented it all, and squealed 
till it seemed some part of him must burst. Mrs. Todd and Mrs. Anderson
                  and Judy Jubb each had a go at him. "Must have the 
wind," murmured Mrs. Ryan, feelingly, and Mrs. Johnson agreed with her
                  by nodding her head. Mother took him again and showed 
him the dog, but he didn't care for dogs. Then Sal ran out with him
                  and<span class="pb"> [PAGE 248] </span>put him on "the
 gee-gee"—Dad's old moke that stood buried in thought at the fence—and 
he was quiet.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">A long table erected in the barn was 
laden with provisions, and Dad invited the company to "come along and 
make a start."
                  They crowded in and stared about. Green boughs and 
corn-cobs hung on the walls; some bags of shelled corn stood in one 
corner;
                  and from a beam dangled a set of useless old 
cart-harness that Dad used to lend to anyone wanting to borrow. Dad and 
Paddy
                  Maloney took up the carving. Dad stood at one end of 
the table—Paddy at the other. Both brandished long knives. Dad proceeded
                  silently—Paddy with joyous volubility. "Fowl or pig?" 
he shouted to them, and rattled the knife, and piled the provender on
                  their plates, and told them to "back in their carts" 
when they wanted more; and he called the minister "boss." Paddy was in
                  his element.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">'T was a magnificent feast, though, and
 went off most successfully. It went off until only the ruins remained. 
Then the party
                  returned to the house and danced. Through the 
afternoon, and far into the night, the concertina screeched its cracked 
refrain,
                  while the forms of weary females, with muffled infants
 in arms, hovered about the drays in the yard, and dog-tired men, soaked
                  to the knees with dew-wet grass, bailing and blocking 
horses in a paddock corner, took strange, shadowy shape,—until, when
                  all was bright and the sun seemed near, the last dray 
rolled heavily away from the christening of Bartholomew.

Box of Dead Roses.</h4>
               Ethel Mills
               
               <p class="noindent">THE old lady was a most amusing 
creature, and she had a past which was a record amongst pasts. Only that
 she was rich enough
                  to buy the whole district, its "society" would have 
"cut" her long ago; as it was, people only talked about her with meaning
                  looks and whispered condemnation. At least, the 
generation to which she belonged did that; the younger one only looked 
and
                  wondered. Bent with rheumatism, bushy-browed, 
fierce-eyed and hard-featured—there remained no trace of the beauty and 
charm
                  which (so report said) had sent more than one good man
 to the devil.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">On sunny days she would have her chair 
moved on to the wide, vine-sheltered verandah. She liked to see what was
 going on;
                  and she said that in Australia most things happened on
 verandahs. This particular one had been planned and built in early
                  pioneering days, and had, no doubt, seen many ups and 
downs of varied incident.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">One could listen to her by the hour 
when she was in the vein for remembering pages from her own life or from
 other lawless
                  lives of early days, when all country west of the 
station was unknown Australia. Like most old people, she was given to 
repetition,
                  but she told me a story once which neither I nor 
anyone else could ever induce her to tell again.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">It was about a young wife—the most 
innocent of brides, who thought the world of her husband, and had no 
wish or look for other
                  men. Yet the house was full of other men in those 
days, and they all gave thoughts or looks, more or less, to the 
prettiest
                  woman in the district. Every evening she used to stand
 at her bedroom door, looking along the verandah, until she saw her
                  husband<span class="pb"> [PAGE 250] </span>returning 
from his work; and every evening he brought her a rose from the big bush
 by the steps. That was during the first
                  months of her marriage. Next year, the rose-bush bore 
as abundantly as ever, but the man often forgot to pick a flower for
                  her; and, after a time, he forgot altogether.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The young wife was painfully ideal and 
long-suffering, and never gave him a word of reproach; she was still so 
much in love
                  with him that she was shy, and blushed like a girl 
when he came near her unexpectedly. "Fancy: after two years of married
                  life!" And the old lady smiled wickedly, and 
continued:
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"She was tired one night, and went to 
bed early, leaving her husband smoking and reading in the dining-room; 
but it was so
                  hot that she presently got up, threw on a gown, and 
strolled along the verandah in the shadow for a breath of cool air. The
                  sultriness of the air brought out the strongest scent 
of the moonflowers. Just there, at the corner near the rose-bush, she
                  saw her husband with his arms round a woman, kissing 
her lips over and over again—they were full, very red lips, such as men
                  like to kiss.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"The woman was one of the 
housemaids—the soft-voiced, self-contained, velvet-footed one who 
usually brought in the tray for
                  supper, and whose eyes never left the floor as she did
 so—a girl who seemed to have no thought beyond her duties.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"The wife heard enough to show her that
 the woman had thoughts for many things besides—enough to tell her that 
those kisses
                  were not the first by any means; that the man's life 
had been a long lie, except, perhaps, during the very early days of 
marriage.
                  She liked to think that he was all hers then. A 
delusion also, possibly; but a harmless one.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"As it was, she stole off to bed 
without saying a word. I call that a 'verandah tragedy,' my dear; 
because her whole nature
                  changed in a few moments. Not that there was much to 
notice one way or the other at first—except that she said she could not
                  bear the scent of the moonflowers, and had the creeper
 taken up at the roots. She did not even send away the housemaid. Why
                  should she? But things were a great deal more pleasant
 for the 'other<span class="pb"> [PAGE 251] </span>men' afterwards—a 
great deal, my dear! She used to sing and play to them, and dance with 
them, and flirt with them, and fill
                  the house with visitors, and so on—in fact, she was a 
beauty, and had only just awakened to a knowledge of her power. You
                  see, the station and money belonged to her; so she was
 freer than most wives.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"There was the baby, of course—a 
lovely, soft-faced little thing that used to take its mid-day sleep in a
 string hammock,
                  swung up there by the trellis. She was fond of the 
child; yet, when it died and was buried by the lagoon in the garden, she
                  used to sit dry-eyed, looking at the hammock that 
swung loosely in every breeze without its accustomed burden. She even 
said
                  she was not sorry; because the boy might have grown up
 to break some woman's heart, and the world was well rid of the breed.
                  Perhaps it was best so; though—looking at the other 
side of the question—he might have lived to blush for his mother.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"One day her husband was brought in, 
dead—kicked by the horse he was trying to catch in the yard. They 
carried him straight
                  up the verandah to the big spare-room, and the blood 
was dripping, dripping all the way.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"She was a tidy, methodical woman 
always, and she sent for the housemaid—the velvet-footed one—and bade 
her wash the boards.
                  The girl had a wonderful power of self-command 
usually, yet, at sight of that blood, she shivered and trembled like one
 with
                  the palsy. Sentimental people said the wife was 
perfectly inhuman to think of the state of her verandah at such a 
time—and,
                  of course, a kind friend told her. She laughed as she 
said, 'No! I am not heart-broken. I went through that experience two
                  years ago.'
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Well, my dear" (and the old lady's 
voice sounded a little tired), "she lived a long, long life, and rather a
 varied and interesting
                  one, from an outsider's point of view, at any rate. I 
often sit and think of her and of many things that happened on this
                  old verandah, but of late years I forget a great deal.
 I like best to remember the days when the young wife used to stand
                  listening,<span class="pb"> [PAGE 252] </span>listening
 for the husband's step—the sweetest music in the world to her.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No doubt she was an arrant little fool
 and bored him to death. I think, now, that he was no worse than the 
majority of men:
                  a clever, interesting woman could have managed him. 
She became all that afterwards—for other men; but, as I said before, she
                  was a totally different woman. Live every inch of your
 life, my dear!" finished the old lady, impressively. "One life, one
                  love!—the idea is perfectly absurd."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Two years later I saw the old lady 
again—feebler, worn in body and mind. She still sat in sunny weather on 
the verandah, but
                  now she always had a little cardboard box on her lap, 
caressing it with her withered fingers.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Look, my dear!" she said; "this box is
 full of dead rose-leaves—they all came off that bush by the corner, 
years ago. Young
                  people are <i>so</i> careless and forgetful. I may die
 at any moment, and unless I had it with me they would never remember to
 bury it in my grave.
                  They are the dearest things I possess; the reason why 
they are so dear I shall carry a secret to my grave also."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The old lady had forgotten that she had
 ever told me a story with roses in it.</p>

               <p class="noindent">THE magpies had said good-night to 
the setting sun, and already darkness was moving through the dead 
timber. The first notes
                  of night-birds came from the ridges, and a curlew 
mourned in the reeds of a creek.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">My brother Will shook his reins and 
rode away.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Good-bye, Sis," he said; "I will be 
home pretty early."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I smiled, knowing that he reckoned 
without his host. Will was visiting Lizzie Lacy, and Lizzie had a sweet 
face. Love's pretty
                  trickeries upset many promises, and I knew that my 
brother would not return till the small hours. But what was love to me—a
                  simple country girl with a heart to lose and nobody to
 find it?
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The cold chilled my fingers, and I 
shuddered. I was alone, with no one to talk to. Mother and father had 
gone to Bathurst
                  that day, and evil men walked the roads, lured west by
 the gleam of gold. As Will disappeared in the distance, fear struck
                  through me like a chill wave. There was a dance at 
Staunton's, and Mary had invited me. I was sorry now that I had refused
                  her. Still, if Mary's heart had been as perfect as her
 face, she would not have said hard things of poor me. She should have
                  schooled her tongue, although she might be a fine 
woman—which was trooper Casey's estimate of her. The little successes 
that
                  please a woman had spoilt her, gilding her pride till 
it dazzled one painfully. If I had grey eyes, it was God who had 
coloured
                  them; and someone has since told me that it is the 
pleasantest colour of all. She had said, as well, that my cheeks were 
red—country
                  complexion. I blessed God for that also, because it 
meant health and strength. They could be pale enough at times—but pale
                  only when hers would have been ashen.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I remembered myself and laughed. All 
this bitterness because<span class="pb"> [PAGE 254] </span>Will was 
visiting Lizzie Lacy, and no one was coming to kiss my hand! Silly 
Carrie, I said to myself, you must bide your time.
                  You are over-young yet to harbour these thoughts. Time
 will surely bring you the rose, and as surely the thorn that wounds.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I had turned to enter the house when 
Sally whinnied from a distance, and came down the green lane between the
 cultivation-paddocks
                  at a high trot, her silver tail lifted in excitement 
and streaming out behind her. She halted at the slip-rails and stretched
                  her head over them, coyly inviting a caress. I gave 
her a cake, smoothed her velvet nose, and talked to her till the trees
                  in the distance were very dim. Now, while I fondled, I
 noticed a curious inattentiveness in the mare's manner. She seemed
                  to heed me with one ear only. The other continually 
flickered back and quivered as though distracted by a distant sound. 
Listen
                  intently as I might, I could discover nothing. Peer as
 I would, I saw dead trees and naught else. But this listening and 
peering
                  made me fretful and afraid; and, with a final pull at 
Sally's forelock—a lingering pull that told how loath I was to leave
                  her—I turned and entered the house.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The fire burned steadily. All the 
little sticks that splash and splutter and noise so much were in white 
heaps, and only two
                  great logs of ironbark glowed sullenly. I lit a lamp, 
sat down, and gazed into the fire: sweet pastime for pensive moments.
                  At a girl's age-of-dreams, questions come in troops, 
and a log's red side is often rich with fancy-food. My head pillowed
                  on an arm, I looked sideways down. The fire drowsed my
 eyes, and in a little while sleep shut them wholly. Remember, at that
                  period Crime went down the roads in many guises!
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I awoke with a start and looked towards
 the door. Two men stood in the room—a tall and a short man. They were 
dressed in sailor
                  clothes, and the eyes of one squinted horribly.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Who are you?" I said, rising to my 
feet and feeling strangely nervous.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Weary men, lassie," said the tall man.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"All the way from Sydney," added the 
other.</p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 255] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">"With not a bite for two blessed days,"
 continued the first.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"And ne'er a sup," said the second.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Indeed," I remarked, pretending 
sympathy with their lie; "that is hard. But I will give you full and 
plenty, and when you
                  are satisfied you must go—for," I continued, thinking 
to soften the words, "we do not allow any strangers to sleep here."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yes," said the tall man; "feed us 
well, good lassie."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"And," added the other, "being 
satisfied, we'll leave you all alone."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then they both chuckled, and moved to 
the table.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">As I laid cold meat and cream and bush 
honey before them, a nervousness assailed me that made my hands dance.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"All alone, lassie?" said the tall man 
at last, throwing himself back in his chair.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yes," I replied, but—recognising my 
mistake instantly—continued: "That is, for a little while. I expect my 
brother every
                  instant—he is with trooper Casey."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The short man lit his pipe, the tall 
one following suit. "Time to be gone, then," remarked the latter.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The other drew the stem from his lips 
and expelled a long white plume. "Which first?" he said.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"The gilt," said the tall man.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I heard the words, and suddenly sprang 
up and ran for the door. "Money first," I thought; "what second?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Ah, would you!" said the short man, 
leaping in front.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Let me pass!" I cried; "someone is 
coming."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He did not move, but stood with folded 
arms, smiling coarsely.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"A sweetheart, perhaps, lassie?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"My brother," I answered.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The tall man opened the door, put out 
his head, and listened. A moment after he drew in and shut the door.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No one," he said; "the lassie is 
mistaken."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Come!" said the short man, extending 
his arms.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I retreated as he advanced, till at 
length I stood by the fire. I was all flushed with rage, and cold with 
fear.</p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 256] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">"My brother is a big man," I said; "he 
could kill you both with one blow."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">They laughed brutally, and the short 
man said, "He has a pretty sister."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"If you are men you will not harm me. 
Tell me what you want, and I will give it you."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Take her at her word," interrupted the
 tall man, coming forward.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I will," replied the other. "What will
 you give us?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What do you want?" I asked, 
brightening.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"One thing and another, lassie," said 
he.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Tobacco," suggested his companion; 
"tea and sugar and flour——"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"A word in your ear, lassie!" 
interrupted the short man, touching me with an outstretched hand.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">But I drew away, and tried to look down
 from my little height.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Go out of the door, sir!—this is my 
father's house!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Pert words from pretty lips," said the
 short man. "A kiss! —a kiss!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">With that he had me in his arms, and 
drew me in close. I struggled, at first in silence, but at the touch of 
his bearded face
                  threw back my head and filled the house with cries. He
 did not desist—only grew fiercer; nor did his fellow make any motion
                  to release me. His grasp was like that of a vyce, and 
blue marks remained long after. Once in the struggle I saw stars, and
                  thought a wicked dream had passed. A gust of cold wind
 struck my cheeks, and I strove to free myself. Then the wind blew 
again,
                  and again I saw stars—the door was open and someone 
stood in the doorway. It was a man—tall as a giant, I thought, and the
                  curse he thundered seemed like a great song.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The sailor released me and drew apart, 
laughing to lighten his guilt.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"God bless you!" I said, moving to the 
door—both hands on my heart, for it was panting fiercely.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Before I reached him the stranger 
raised a hand to make me<span class="pb"> [PAGE 257] </span>pause. He 
had a gun at his shoulder,—a long, bright barrel that gleamed fitfully.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"In the nick of time," he said calmly; 
"which first?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I looked at the two sailors. They stood
 close together, distressed by fear. The tall man slanted sideways, like
 a sapling
                  from the wind, and the short one cowered behind an 
upraised arm as if to ward a blow.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Which first?" said the stranger again.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Neither!" I replied, shuddering.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He sloped his rifle a little, looked at
 me cynically, and hinted something that filled me with shame.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No, no," I cried; "do not say that! I 
never saw them before, and I am a good girl."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">A smile crept across his lips, and his 
wide, dark eyes softened.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I believe it," he said shortly.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He stepped forward and halted in the 
centre of the room.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You were hungry?" he said to the short
 man.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The man nodded.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"And she fed you on cream and honey—the
 best she had?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The man did not answer.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The gun went to the shoulder again, and
 the dark eyes looked along the levelled barrel.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"And you wanted to pay her in your own 
foul coin. Now for this," he continued, "I've a mind to put hot lead in 
your brain."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I ran forward with a great dread lest 
he should do as he threatened.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Go away!" I cried to the sailors; "go 
quickly, while you are safe!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The men turned as if to slink off, but 
the stranger warned them to stand very still.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You must be punished for this night's 
work," he said; "and then you may go—both of you—as far as Berrima."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The two men started and eyed him 
keenly.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Just so, just so," he said, nodding 
from one to the other; "a guilty conscience, eh?"</p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 258] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">They scowled and sank their eyes, and 
he turned to me.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Get your whip!" he said.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I stood irresolute, and he continued:</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"My arm is tired holding this gun. They
 should have been dead long ago. Get your whip!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I ran away, got my whip, and returned.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Go forward and strike that man across 
the face."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"It would be cruel," I replied.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Quick! or he will be dead before you 
reach him!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then I was in front of the sailor.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Lift your arm," the stranger said.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then he told me to strike with all my 
force—"As you would a wicked steer."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I obeyed with some hesitation, and 
struck lightly. But presently faint-heartedness forsook me. At the 
second lifting of the
                  whip a sudden spirit of mastery surged my arm with 
fierceness, so that I dealt some savage blows. The sailor sheltered his
                  eyes with his hands and cried aloud for mercy. Then I 
suddenly remembered myself and drew away, shuddering and half in tears.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Good!" said the stranger. "And now for
 the other—they are mates."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"He did not offer me any hurt," I 
replied.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The stranger looked at him. "You are 
lucky," he said.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The man's face lightened with pleasure.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"But less lucky than you think, my good
 man," he continued.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I noticed the white fear that came into
 the tall man's face, and the sudden upward look of his companion.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Come here!" said the stranger, 
beckoning to the short man.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The sailor approached, trembling. After
 a few paces had been taken, "Halt!" the stranger cried.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The man stood still on the instant.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Squint-eyed, and with the limp of the 
leg-iron—dressed like a sailor!" said the stranger, in loud, clear 
tones. "Get some
                  saddle straps, my girl!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Why?"</p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 259] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">"Get them!" he said, shortly.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I went away, and displeasure at his 
brusque manner made my cheeks burn. Did it paint them also—that he spoke
 so gently on
                  my return?
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I am not used to ladies, and I mean no
 offence," he said.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I forgave him, and said that I had felt
 none. "Your action to-night shows that you are a good man."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Perhaps," he replied; "but one star 
does not make a heaven."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He was silent, and I forebore to ask 
what he meant. He motioned for the straps, and I gave them.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then he turned to the men, and his 
voice hardened.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Down on your faces!" he thundered, 
"quick! quick! both of you, or——"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">They were down on the instant, abject 
as worms.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Now take this gun, my girl," he said, 
"and if that man so much as wriggles, shoot him. I will manage the 
other."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The man was fashioned to command. I 
took the gun, and if the prostrate figure had moved then it would never 
have moved again.
                  But the sailors were utterly cowed, and did not murmur
 while the stranger pinioned their hands behind them. This done, he
                  rolled them over and looked down at them.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What does this mean?" I said.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"A stripe for trooper Casey," he 
replied, and laughed.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"For trooper Casey? I do not 
understand?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You will, in time," he replied.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">With that, I had to content myself. Who
 this man was, with the command on his lips, and the 
disobey-me-if-you-dare in his
                  eyes, I did not know. I only know that he had reserves
 of gentleness, which spoke through his harsher moods like a bird's
                  song in a storm.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You, there!" he said to the short man;
 "do you know what they are doing at Weatherley's?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The sailor turned his face aside, and 
was mute.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Or you?" to the tall man.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No," the man replied. "Where is 
Weatherley's?"</p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 260] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">"Liars—both of you!" said the stranger.
 "Weatherley's, under the Range."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What are they doing?" I interposed.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Burying a dead woman, he replied, 
looking from one to the other of the prostrate men, and nodding as he 
changed his gaze.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"How sad!" I cried. "Poor Mrs. 
Weatherley! When did she die?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yesterday."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"She was a strong woman."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"She met someone stronger."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You mean Death!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Death, and two devils!"—he ground his 
teeth.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I looked at him in wonder.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Two devils—what do you mean?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The short man lay on his side, looking 
up as a beaten dog looks at his master. The stranger spurned him with a 
foot.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Answer!" he said; "which of you killed
 her?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Not me," groaned the sailor; "'t was 
the bushrangers."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You liar!" cried the stranger in a 
rising, incredulous voice, as though he doubted his own ears. "We do 
not——" He paused
                  and looked at me, and saw that he had revealed 
himself.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Ah!" I whispered as he turned away. I 
understood now, and yet he did not seem as black as people painted him.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I tried to hide it," he said; "but it 
slipped out. It is a bad thing even at its best."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then he looked very downcast, and I 
pitied him. An angel impulse stirred me, and I stepped forward, raised 
my face, and kissed
                  him.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Good!" he said, his fine eyes 
flashing, "'tis a long time since—"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He lowered his voice and continued, as 
if to himself: "But what does it matter? She is only a child."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"To-night has made me a woman," I 
replied.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No, no! you are a child. No woman 
would do a thing like that. But some day you will be a woman. Then you 
will kiss with<span class="pb"> [PAGE 261] </span>the lips only, not 
with the heart—cheating the heart that loves you."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">It was some minutes before he spoke 
again.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I saw a horse in the stockyard," he 
said; "bring him round. I want you to go somewhere."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">And when Sally was ready at the door 
and I in the saddle, he continued: "Ride to Staunton's—Casey is there. 
Tell him"—this
                  with a low laugh—"that the man who borrowed his horse 
at Weatherboard waits here to give him a stripe in exchange. Come back
                  with him yourself."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I turned Sally's head to be gone 
immediately.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Wait—another word! Would you like to 
see me dead or trooper Casey dead?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Oh, no; how can you ask?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I distrust women," he returned, "since
 I met Judas in petticoats."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Try me," I replied; "I could not be 
false after what you have done."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"When you come to the bridge, cooee! I 
will be here watching these brutes, and when I hear your cry I will up 
and away."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">As Sally moved off some words followed 
from the door, where he stood in the light.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Good-bye, little girl!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Good-bye! and I will always remember 
you."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">A curlew wailed, and the stranger 
laughed—to make the parting easy, it seemed. Yet something that Nature 
had put into the
                  curlew's wail went through the man's voice and 
saddened me for many days. It seemed that both bird and man mourned 
something
                  lost.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I galloped along the track that made a 
siding in the green hill and slanted to the creek. Sally's hoofs rattled
 on the turpentine
                  planking of the bridge, and presently struck fire from
 the ironstone on the farther side. Where the track wound through wild
                  hops I gave her free head; for there was open country.
 Where the scrub crept in she slackened of her own will, not liking
                  the rebound<span class="pb"> [PAGE 262] </span>of the 
bushes. In a little while we came to a second creek, where bullocks' 
heads in a white line made stepping-stones. She
                  crossed it with a bound and a splash, and climbed the 
slope beyond in a few strides. Another mile brought me to Staunton's
                  log-fence, and through the trees I saw bright windows.
 A little later there came to me a concertina's music and other sounds
                  of merry-making.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I fastened Sally to the stockyard gate,
 and walked through the doorway. A number of couples were there, 
swinging round and
                  round in a dance. As I walked into the room I felt 
strangely out of harmony with the surroundings, the music having put a
                  spirit in my feet that made them seem to drag.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Mary Staunton had trooper Casey for a 
partner. She looked very fine and pale, but as she went by she scarcely 
deigned to notice
                  me. Trooper Casey was six feet high, and had curly 
hair—the hair that women fancy. Every time he wheeled his metal buttons
                  flashed. When the dance finished he was near me. I 
touched him on the arm.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Mr. Casey!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Hallo, Carrie!" said Mary Staunton, in
 affected welcome; "how late you are!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I didn't come to dance, Mary—only to 
see Mr. Casey."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Ah, I should have known," she 
answered, with a little mocking laugh, and with a glance at my dress 
where Sally had splashed
                  it in crossing the creek.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I tossed my head and turned from her.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Trooper Casey, can you spare a 
moment?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What do you want? Say what you want, 
here and now," said Mary Staunton. "That is, if you're not afraid of us 
hearing it."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I intended this for you alone"—I 
addressed the trooper—"but now"—with a sidelong look at his 
sweetheart—"everyone may hear
                  it."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What is it, Miss Anson?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Do you want a stripe?"</p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 263] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">"Why, one'd think you were the 
Governor's lady," said Mary Staunton, laughing so that I blushed.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I took no notice of her, other than 
turning my back, and then I smiled quietly as I spoke.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"A gentleman waits at our house to pay 
you for a horse he borrowed at Weatherboard."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I watched him keenly to see how he took
 the news. On his cheeks two red spots stood out and burned. He gnawed 
his under-lip,
                  and there was a suppressed anger in his eyes, that 
glowed like covered fires. From those standing around there went up a 
great
                  laugh, and Casey turned to a group who forced their 
merriment overlong.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You are great laughers," said he; "but
 are you men enough to fight?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">None of them made a movement to accept 
the challenge; but, on the other hand, it was curious to see how 
speedily the laughter
                  faded from their faces, giving place to something 
almost sad.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then up spoke Mary Staunton.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Carrie Anson," said she, with 
tremulous white lips, "if you come here to insult people, you'd better 
stay away."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Don't mind her, Mary," said the 
trooper; "it's a trick some fool has made her play."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Indeed it is not," I replied. "The man
 who gave me that message is waiting at our house with two sailors, and 
one of them"—I
                  dropped my voice so that only he and Mary 
heard—"killed Mrs. Weatherly."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The trooper started, as though shot 
through; looked me in the eyes, and drew a long breath. "By God!" he 
cried, and moved
                  towards the door.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"It is three to one, Mary," he said.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Do not go!" she answered; "you may be 
killed."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"It is man to man, trooper!" I 
interrupted; "two are bound and the third keeps watch."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Stuff!" exclaimed Mary, viciously: "<i>he</i>
 keep watch! You will not go alone, trooper."
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 264] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">"Alone! I must take the man. Where are 
my carbine and cap?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Take someone!" pleaded Mary.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No," Casey replied, "I will do this 
myself. If I succeed you know what it means,"—and he looked earnestly 
into her eyes.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I laughed pleasantly.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I shall be a bridesmaid—eh, Mary?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">She did not smile, but went off with a 
set face, swaying her skirts behind her.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"With the help of God, Miss Anson," 
whispered Casey, confidentially, "I shall make three prisoners 
to-night."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"With the help of God, you shall not, 
trooper Casey!" I whispered to myself.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">As the trooper turned to leave the 
room, his carbine on his back, his sabre at his side, and his cap 
pressing a cushion of
                  brown curls, I did not wonder Mary Staunton had lost 
her heart to him. He was a man to delight any eyes.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Some came forward and offered to assist
 him, but these he refused coldly. I passed out and was in the saddle 
before he had
                  mounted.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then he said, in surprise, "You must 
stay here, Miss Anson."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I must go home, trooper Casey."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"There may be bloodshed."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"There must be none."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You are very brave," he said, 
suspiciously; "are you sure it is no hoax?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Follow me, if you are not a coward!" I
 replied.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">As I passed her, Mary Staunton muttered
 something about "an interfering minx." The trooper she warned to be 
careful. In my
                  heart I believe that she thought his chief peril lay 
in me, and I laughed to think that, after all, an outlaw may not be the
                  greatest danger in a man's path.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">As the trooper rode after, his bridle 
jingled in the silence.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Miss Anson," said he, "these sailors 
that you spoke of—was one a tall man?"</p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 265] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yes."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"And the other short?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"With a squint."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Just so,"—and he relapsed into 
silence.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The track was narrow, with no room for 
two horses. This prevented us from riding abreast, and gave me an excuse
 to keep in
                  front. Several times Casey urged his horse forward, 
but I patted Sally and she kept her place. At the creek he made a bold
                  bid to front me, but the mare flashed forward and 
headed him at the farther side.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Draw aside, and let me ride in front, 
Miss Anson."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I answered that I knew the way quite 
well.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"That may be, but I have a different 
reason."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I was dumb, having nothing to answer.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"There may be danger ahead," he 
continued; "and you are foolish."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I cast about for an answer, and 
remembered a last week's storm.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"There is danger," I replied; "a fallen
 tree, and you might founder in the branches."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He muttered something under his breath,
 but I did not catch the word.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">In a little while we reached the fallen
 tree and rode round it. Beyond he spoke again.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You can have no objection now."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"None whatever," I said, "only that a 
little way along a swarm of bees have fastened to a limb. You might 
mistake them for
                  a wart and brush them with your shoulder. That would 
not be pleasant, would it?"—and I laughed to gild the prevarication.
                  But Casey, seeing no humour in the situation, remained
 dumb.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Presently I cried out to him to beware 
of the bees, and he listed in his saddle.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Now?" be asked.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Not yet, trooper; we are in the bush 
and I prefer to stay where I am, because if you rode in front the 
branches would come
                  back and sting Sally's eyes."
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 266] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">"Rubbish!" muttered Casey.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">When we were through the bush and among
 the hops, he suddenly bade me halt.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You must play no tricks, Miss Anson!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"La! who is playing them, Mr. Casey?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"The man at your house is a desperado."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Is he, indeed?"—with all the innocence
 of the world in my voice.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"And you are an accomplice."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Dear me, what does that mean, 
trooper?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"It means that you must stay where you 
are."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"But I must go home."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Then I shall arrest you."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Arrest me, and let three grown men go 
free!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"But you make it necessary," he said.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Trooper, the desperado is a brave man,
 and would be as likely to kill you as you would be to kill him."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Have no fears for me, Miss Anson."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I have none."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Then they are for——'</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"The man who saved me?"—and I went away
 like an arrow. It was the first time I had come into conflict with the 
law, and the
                  situation thrilled me. Casey with a great oath 
thundered close behind, calling on me in a low voice to hold up, and 
muttering
                  dire consequences. I laughed, bent forward, and bade 
Sally do her best. It was necessary, since his horse had better pace
                  and gained greatly at every stride. Now the animal's 
nose was at my saddle, now at Sally's shoulder, and now we raced level
                  to the bridge.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I rose in the saddle, threw up my face,
 and sent a long, long "<i>Coo-ee! Coo-ee!</i>" speeding across the 
open.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Hush, you hoyden!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I tugged at the reins, throwing Sally 
back on her haunches, and again I cooeed.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then I sat back and listened. The 
trooper was now a fading<span class="pb"> [PAGE 267] </span>bulk in the 
dark. The speed of his horse on the siding was terrible, and his rein 
and sabre jingled fiercely.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then, one—two—three, came the sounds of
 slip-rails falling. I sat back in the saddle with a sigh of deep 
content, and breathed
                  as I had not for many minutes. Far and farther away I 
heard another horse, his hoof-thuds in the dead timber sounding like
                  footfalls in an empty house.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You have done good work to-night," 
said trooper Casey, when I entered the room a little later; "fine work 
for a decent, self-respecting
                  girl."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I picked up his sleeve where the silver
 braid circled it.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"This looks lonely, trooper: it would 
be prettier if there were two of them, would it not?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He smiled in a wintry way, and this 
gave me heart to say that the stranger was not so bad, after all.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Casey shook his head.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Bad enough," he replied.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Will came in shortly after, and these 
words followed:</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Where did you meet him?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"At the boundary gate," Will answered.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What did he say?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Looked along his gun and ordered me to
 hoist my hands."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"And then?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Took my horse and watch—and left me 
his animal."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Never mind," said the trooper quietly,
 "I have two prisoners. And he was not so bad, after all—eh, Miss 
Anson?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"No, trooper; especially if it should 
happen that the horse he left is the same that he borrowed."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Casey rose to look out at the dawn.</p>

               Alex. Montgomery
               
               <p class="noindent">ACROSS the long perspective of the 
mangrove flats the sun glared fierce and crimson. From the black 
mud-banks white, pestilential
                  vapours rose upon the torpid air. A subtler miasm 
quivered over the long stretches of mephitic ooze, against the sickly 
green
                  of which gleamed out the hideous reds and yellows of 
fantastic crabs that scuttled—as the boat came near—into pools prismatic
                  with stagnation. Beneath the slimy surface the banded 
water-snakes glanced to and fro: from the reed-beds came in hungry 
swarms
                  the tiger-mosquitoes; and from the mangrove-roots the 
sword-flies darted out in swift detachments upon the half-nude 
rowers—sweltering
                  in a bath of vegetable fetor.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Of the white men, one would have fired 
at the log-like immobility of a crocodile, basking untroubled of that 
"instinctive
                  terror of man" which is but one of man's own 
anthropocentric delusions. But the other said, "No!" He was a tan-faced 
old fellow
                  with a wide, grim mouth and stiff, white, ape-like 
whiskers.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Fire a shot here and we may as well go
 back! Curious acoustics, these places have. The report of a gun wanders
 up and down
                  the swamps and creeks as if it was never going to 
stop!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"You've been here before, then?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Wouldn't be here now if I hadn't, and 
if I didn't count myself fever-proof. But as for you, Green——"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Green—young and smooth-faced, but big, 
brick-red, and square-jawed—cut in, "No more of me, old man! I'll see 
this thing through!
                  And, anyhow, if <i>I</i>'m not fever-proof, I'm pretty
 well past praying for by this time! See?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I see you're good stuff, at any rate! 
And nothing else will do for this job. Let's sum up—leaving out such 
items as heat
                  and<span class="pb"> [PAGE 269] </span>insects. Fever,
 snakes, sunstroke, poisoned arrows from the Dyaks, treachery from these
 chaps of our own, and, after all—perhaps
                  nothing at the end of it!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I'm game for all but the last. 
Heavens! Redfern, that would be a crusher."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Crusher?" Redfern leaned over to the 
young fellow. "This is it. I'm five and sixty; here's my first chance of
 a pile, and
                  I've staked on it whatever's left me,—say ten or 
fifteen years. It's worth it. But, you—you might have lived for seventy 
years,
                  yet."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Confound it! man, you talk as if it 
was all up with me. My chance is as good as yours, at all events."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The other man said nothing. He had 
private reasons for being of a different opinion.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Through pallid, steam-like mist—the 
visible breath of Death—the rising moon made faint light for the two men
 groping in the
                  stinking mud, and shrinking, now and then, from the 
horrid, unnamed things their hands encountered. For half-an-hour they
                  toiled, till to the knees and elbows they were foul 
with evil-smelling filth. Then Green gave up.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"This is the place, right enough," he 
said—"according to your map. Triangle between three creeks; gravel bluff
 at one end;
                  three mangroves in the middle. And between them we've 
searched nearly every inch. If your friend Kussoab wasn't a first-class
                  liar, he was mad! Either way, it's—ugh!" Something was
 wriggling from the mud between his feet, and, springing smartly from
                  the spot, he slipped and fell backwards.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"It's only a goocha!" Redfern kicked 
the fish-like saurian ten feet away. "What a fool you are: Hullo!—are 
you hurt?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">For Green lay where he had fallen—not 
hurt, but thinking hard. One hand, as he came down, had touched a stone,
 and any stone,
                  in that absolutely rockless region, must be the stone 
they sought—the stone which covered the treasure he had till now but
                  half-believed in. And with belief came greed and quick
 resolve. A part!—he would have all! "This old man's day is past!—mine's<span
 class="pb"> [PAGE 270] </span>to come! And what I mean for him, no 
doubt, is no more than he meant for me!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">All this in the ten seconds before 
Redfern helped him to his feet. "Let's get back to the boat," Green 
said, then, "for the
                  present, at any rate. I feel infernally queer."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Back to the boat they picked their 
squelching way, the elder man puzzled, but not yet suspicious. It was 
when they had drunk
                  of "gunny-water," made of rum and quinine, that a 
glimmer of the truth came to Redfern,—the more readily that he had 
himself
                  determined, if the find were made, to "lose" his 
partner in this hellish wet wilderness of Manduka. For thus together do 
the
                  wits of scoundrels jump.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Thicker still the ghastly fever-fog 
hung round the shadowy boat; but the moon was in mid-heaven and the 
light had increased,
                  when Green sat up and looked around the boat—silent, 
but for the snoring of the weary Malay rowers. Neither was there visible
                  the inevitable cheroot-glow which would have told of 
Redfern's wakefulness. Green stole from under the awning and over the
                  side.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Redfern, a minute later, raised his 
head and listened—then took his rifle and slipped also away into the 
half-illumined mist,
                  which immediately thereafter yielded up a dusky figure
 that got hastily into the boat and woke its fellows, for the Malay
                  crew had, since dark, been one man short—a secret 
watcher upon the doings of the whites. Then, by the light of a little 
cocoa-nut
                  lamp, six swarthy faces gloated over a broken kris—the
 fragment of the blade rust-eaten to a rugged skewer, but the hilt,
                  of damp-defying gold, set thick with stones that 
sparkled even through the clinging slime.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The frogs forbore their raucous 
chorus—alarmed by Redfern's strident laughter.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What a guileless innocent you take me 
for! You sneak back here when you think I'm asleep, and you show me a 
hole that"—with
                  a sneer—"somebody else made! Really, now, young 
man—which<span class="pb"> [PAGE 271] </span>is to say, young scoundrel!
 young thief!—you might credit me with some brains."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Green stamped up a shower of mud. 
"Scoundrel yourself! Brains or no brains!—there's the hole, and <i>I</i>
 didn't make it. And, besides, if I found anything, where is it?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Redfern threw up his rifle. "Exactly!" 
he said. "That's what I want to know. Where is it?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Green stooped his head. "Listen!" he 
said; "there's your answer!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">A hurried sound of oars came faintly 
through the sluggish air, and both men made off, stumbling and 
squattering in their haste
                  to reach the main creek.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">They were too late! A scornful yell 
from far away in the fog was all that answered to their shouts.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">With the earliest grey of morning 
Redfern sprang from the mangrove-root on which he had sat silent for 
hours. "Come!" he said,
                  "let's get away from here, at all events. Getting out 
of the Manduka's another matter!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Green slowly raised himself from the 
mud and lit his pipe. "What chance is there of that?" he asked sullenly.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"About one in a hundred!" Redfern 
answered, belying his belief, for he was a man of science, not 
ill-versed in jungle-craft,
                  and he thought the odds were in favour of his own 
escape—unhampered by a tyro's company.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He eyed his double-rifle as he headed 
westward through the dreary, dripping mangroves. His cartridges—save the
 two in the
                  barrels—had gone with the boat. "I could not spare a 
bullet, even if——' The other called him, and he turned.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Green, up to his ankles in mud, was 
dragging out each foot in turn—only to sink the other deeper as his 
weight came on it.
                  And the up-turned stuff—though the surface was a 
glossy green—was of a dirty saffron hue. A "porridge-pot," Redfern knew 
it
                  for, and, on the instant, turned and made off. 
This—without his intervention—would rid him of his incumbrance, though 
to<span class="pb"> [PAGE 272] </span>see the poor wretch slowly perish 
there was no need. But—blindly rushing from the other's cries—a word 
came to his ears that
                  stopped him.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"The kris!—the kris! I have it, after 
all!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Redfern sped back to where the 
struggling Green—with wild eyes starting from his fear-blanched face—was
 clawing frantically
                  at the viscid horror that, by this time, held him to 
the middle. Testing with his rifle-butt, Redfern swiftly found the limit
                  of the fatal "porridge," and, flinging himself full 
length upon the firmer ground, thrust out the barrels to the utmost.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What did you say about the kris?" he 
panted, as he lay.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I have it!" Green gasped, as he got 
one hand on the muzzles. "If I sink, it sinks with me!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">And, lying thus for life, he plucked 
the rifle towards him—and one charge, exploding, sent its bullet through
 his neck. Then
                  Redfern, stretching eagerly to reach Green's 
inside-pocket—was caught himself!
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">For twenty horrible minutes he fought, 
and prayed, and swore, and yelled to earless solitudes. And, when the 
noise had ceased,
                  a monstrous green batrachian—squatting on the double 
grave—croaked solemnly that all was well!

 I Have Met.</h4>

               <p class="noindent">IT has been remarked that the worst 
use to which you can put a man is to hang him. A mistake. You can put 
him to a still worse
                  use. You can make him a bailiff.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I am writing this article in bed, using
 as a desk a box which at one time, according to the printed legend 
pasted on its lid,
                  contained seven pounds nett of cocoanut ice. It 
commenced its career coldly, this poor little box; but it shall end 
warmly
                  and famously. To-morrow morning I shall split it up 
into neat little splinters, to which I shall deftly set fire, and 
therewith
                  boil my coffee. I know that in years to come, when I 
shall have lost my taste for coffee and all other worldly pleasures,
                  relic collectors will wish that I had not done this 
thing; but one can't boil coffee on posthumous glory.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Alexander Pope is said to have written 
most of his translation of the Iliad in bed, but that was mere luxurious
 laziness on
                  his part. I am writing in bed for the reason that if I
 were up I would have to sit on the floor to write—a position which,
                  besides being uncomfortable, is apt to make one 
round-shouldered.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The intelligent reader will gather from
 the foregoing remarks that the bailiff has been with me. He has been, 
with a vengeance,
                  and liked my taste in furniture so well that he took 
it all away with him, including even my little Japanese tobacco-jar,
                  and a Satsuma spittoon of fantastic elegance. I 
shouldn't have cared so much if he had left me my engraving of Don 
Quixote,
                  which used to bring the tears to my eyes every time I 
looked at it. The noble knight-errant is shown sitting in his chamber,
                  with all his armour around him. His withered hands, 
with their bony knuckles and outstanding veins and sinews, are clasped
                  on the hilt of his long,<span class="pb"> [PAGE 274] </span>cross-hilted
 sword, and there is a look of visionary exaltation in his faded eyes 
which is in itself an inspiration. The valourous
                  Manchegan had also his troubles with the world, even 
as I have mine.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">It is now twelve years ago since I 
gathered my first practical knowledge of bailiffdom. Even then I did not
 see a bailiff
                  in the flesh, but I stood in the place—he had left 
nothing to sit upon—where a bailiff had been, only a few hours before.
                  It was after dusk, one evening in autumn, and, as I 
knocked at the door of the house in which dwelt my guide, philosopher,
                  and friend of those early days, I thought that the 
knock sounded singularly loud, as though the house were empty. So it 
was,
                  in a sense,—its sole contents being my philosopher and
 his wife and family. They were seated on the floor, in a circle, around
                  a sheet of newspaper, upon which were displayed two or
 three loaves of bread, a paper bag containing sugar, a large billycan
                  of tea, and some tinned sardines They were eating with
 their fingers, and drinking in turns out of a pannikin, which passed
                  from hand to hand, in the manner of a bottle at a 
small and informal convivial gathering of friends. "You observe," said 
my
                  philosopher, with a nod at the newspaper, and a wave 
of his hand towards the bare walls, "you observe, my young sage, how
                  little the natural man really needs to satisfy his 
legitimate requirements. All else is mere superfluous luxury. The 
bailiff
                  relieved me of my superfluous luxury this morning. I 
bear him no malice on that account. A man of letters" (my philosopher
                  was a contributor to the weekly papers, but always 
called himself a man of letters) "should fly light in the matter of 
furniture."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I looked at the squabbling children on 
the floor, and thought that the remark might be extended to include 
family as well
                  as furniture.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">My philosopher, however, had his 
revenge on bailiffdom in due course, as will be seen later on.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">A year or so after the foregoing 
incident, which occurred in Melbourne, I was in Sydney lodging in the 
house of a friend,
                  who<span class="pb"> [PAGE 275] </span>also described 
himself as a man of letters. He was, as a matter of fact, a reporter on 
one of the daily papers, but was endowed
                  with tastes and aspirations far above his position. 
These found expression in speckled-green jars, papier-mâché statuettes
                  of classical shepherds and shepherdesses, vases of 
every size and shape, brackets, tables with spiral legs like crossed 
corkscrews,
                  and other articles of virtu too numerous to mention. 
The front room of the little house in which he lived was so crowded with
                  these things that it was seldom opened, except when 
his wife went in to dust them. He had also a library, contained in a 
carven
                  bookcase with glass doors. It consisted of some forty 
or fifty volumes, works of the old dramatists. These were carefully
                  numbered and catalogued, and it was (as Artemus Ward 
called the Tower of London) a Sweet Boon to me to see him, when he 
required
                  a book, gravely refer to a small ledger, neatly 
lettered from A to Z on its outer edge, and then, having discovered the 
registered
                  number of the volume, take the latter out of the 
bookcase with the air of a man who had found what he wanted on the 
shelves
                  of the Bodleian or the Bibliothèque Nationale. Of 
course, Simson (this was not my friend's real name, but it will answer 
quite
                  as well for present purposes) could have put his hand 
upon the book at once, without going through this elaborate mummery,
                  but that would not have been Simson's style. "My 
father," he observed to me upon one occasion, "always kept an index to 
the
                  books in his library, and I do my best to follow in 
his footsteps. I haven't the number of books he had—his library 
contained
                  several thousand volumes; but I can, at least, have an
 index." This filial sentiment was expressed with so much dignity that
                  I almost felt ashamed of myself for having laughed at 
the index.

household, however, was the room in which was stored the gimcrackery 
previously referred to.
                  Simson himself entered it but rarely, and then trod 
softly with slippered feet. I accused him once of going in there to 
worship
                  in secret a hideous porcelain image of the Chinese 
dragon god which stood on the mantelpiece, but he merely smiled and said
                  I was a hopeless Philistine.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 276] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">One morning I came downstairs and found
 the door of the shrine open. I went in, half expecting to surprise 
Simson in the midst
                  of some mysterious rite, but he was not there. There 
was somebody in the room, however. A man with tousled hair, a 
dirty-reddish
                  beard, and a face that looked as if it had been (which
 was, no doubt, the fact) soaking in beer for years, was lying in a
                  loose heap on the dainty green satin sofa, with one of
 his huge feet, encased in a broken blucher, resting carelessly on the
                  glory of the shrine—a tall Japanese vase embellished 
with illustrations of the story of the Forty Ronins. I stared hard at
                  the man, who winked familiarly at me with one 
bloodshot eye, and I walked out of the room, greatly wondering. In the 
dining-room
                  I met Simson with hair on end, and eyes glaring 
wildly. "Who's your friend?" I asked, nodding in the direction of the 
front
                  room.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"He's no friend of mine!" replied 
Simson,—and then a base inspiration seemed to come to him, for he added:
 "He's the wife's
                  uncle."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Of course, the man was a bailiff.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">He had insisted on camping in the front
 room, because he saw that it contained all the really valuable articles
 in the house.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I am glad to say that Simson managed to
 raise the money required to meet the ruffian's demand, and to get rid 
of him before
                  he had been in the house more than a few hours. As it 
was, he left behind him an effluvium of stale alcohol which hung around
                  the place for days afterwards.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Two or three years passed without my 
making any further acquaintance with bailiffdom. And then it came about 
that I stopped
                  one night at a house in Woolloomooloo, wherein dwelt a
 happy family, consisting of a poet, a piano-tuner, a professor of 
mathematics,
                  and an artist who painted religious subjects by 
preference, but, owing to lack of orders in this direction, painted 
panels
                  of bar-screens and picturesque whisky advertisements 
for a living. The house was taken in the name of the artist, he being
                  the<span class="pb"> [PAGE 277] </span>only member of 
the party who did any regular work. The piano-tuner came next in 
financial importance, but he was not a perfect
                  character in other respects. When he earned a few 
shillings by tuning a piano, he often started to tune himself up with 
beer
                  to such an extent that the artist, who was a 
fastidious person when not himself intoxicated, always insisted on his 
sleeping
                  in the wood-shed till he became sober again. As for 
the poet and the professor of mathematics, they also made a little money
                  occasionally,—the poet by writing elegies and 
epitaphs—and the professor by "coaching" students for examinations. They
 brought
                  home their money manfully, and handed it over to the 
artist, who as manfully expended it in the purchase of liquor and tinned
                  provisions for the use of the establishment. Taking 
them altogether, the happy family was the most genial set of Bohemians
                  I have ever had the fortune to meet with. I do not 
even except the piano-tuner, as he made up for his periodical bouts by
                  long spells of self-sacrificing total abstinence, and 
put the money he earned during these intervals into the common fund
                  like a hero. If they had a fault at all it was that 
they were almost too convivial. They used to drink rum at breakfast, and
                  bottled beer in cups at tea-time.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Of course, a menage of this kind was 
too gay to last. The end came, as luck would have it, on the morning 
when I happened
                  to be a guest of the household. I was awakened by 
hearing a sound of voices in the passage—the artist had made up a bed 
for
                  me on the floor of the front room with newspapers, and
 had covered me, in the kindest manner, with one of his great historical
                  cartoons, representing the landing of Captain Cook at 
Botany Bay, the paint upon which was alone sufficient to keep me warm,
                  without taking the canvas into account.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I knew at once what the trouble was—the
 bailiff was in possession. So far, however, he had not penetrated 
beyond the passage,
                  and the artist, with a ring of pathos in his voice 
which revealed to me unsuspected depths of feeling in his nature, was 
imploring
                  him not to take away the furniture without giving him 
(the artist) a chance to find the coin required, or, at any rate, to<span
 class="pb"> [PAGE 278] </span>come to some arrangement with the 
landlord. (The distraint was, I may remark, about to be made for arrears
 of rent).
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Not me!" said the bailiff, a brutal 
miscreant bloated with intemperance; "I'm not that kind of bloomin' 
goat. Fork out the
                  coin at once or I clean out the furnicher."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Heartless wretch!" exclaimed the 
artist, turning away with a choking sob, "do your worst!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The bailiff, signing to his assistant 
to remain in the passage—a wily precaution against any of the furniture 
being removed
                  on the sly—went through the house to take an inventory
 of its contents.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He had not been gone five minutes 
before he was back in the passage again, cursing and blaspheming in a 
most shocking style.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"What's the matter!" his assistant 
asked.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"This is what's the matter!" he replied
 bitterly, kicking a table made out of an old packing-case into the 
passage—"this is
                  the kind of thing they have the blanky cheek to call 
furnicher. Why, s'elp me gawd, there is n't enough in the whole place
                  to pay our blanky fees!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">It was so. Every article of furniture 
in the house was literally home-made out of palings, packing-cases, and 
pieces of old
                  deal board, picked up from time to time by the artist 
and his friends.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I then appreciated the full burlesque 
significance of the pathetic appeal made to the bailiff with regard to 
sparing the furniture.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I am glad to see," observed the artist
 by way of a parting shot, "that your better feelings have prevailed, 
and that you
                  intend to leave me my little household treasures."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The bailiff scowled horribly, and went 
away threatening unutterable things.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"We shall have to move now, boys," said
 the artist, addressing the others; "we can't stand off the landlord any
 more on the
                  strength of our furniture."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I have said that my philosopher 
ultimately had his revenge on bailiffdom. I was on the spot when the 
revenge was consummated,<span class="pb"> [PAGE 279] </span>having 
occasion to call on the philosopher with reference to some impracticable
 scheme peculiarly in his line. There was a
                  van in front of the door, into which a vanman was 
piling tables, chairs, washstands, bedsteads, and other articles of 
domestic
                  use. The philosopher, in his shirt-sleeves, and with 
beads of perspiration rolling down his intellectual forehead, was 
vigorously
                  assisting.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Lend a hand here!" he exclaimed, as he
 caught sight of me.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I followed him into the house and saw, 
lying on a sofa, snoring stertorously, a man who looked like Simson's 
wife's uncle.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Take hold of his head!" said my 
philosopher.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">I took hold of his head. The 
philosopher grasped him by the feet.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Now, lay him gently down on the 
floor—steady!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">We laid him on the floor. The movement 
didn't awake the sodden ruffian, who simply turned over on his side, and
 grunted drunkenly.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Now, take hold of one end of the sofa 
and we'll run it into the van."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Which was accordingly done.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The house was now empty of anything in 
the shape of furniture. My philosopher, after placing a bottle of beer 
by the head
                  of the unconscious man in possession, locked the front
 door and threw the key through the window into the front room.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I don't pretend to be a practical man,
 but I think I managed that little affair pretty well," he remarked, 
making a sign
                  to the vanman to drive on.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"How did you do it?" I enquired.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Well, I happened to meet the bailiff 
on his way down to the house. I knew who he was, and where he was going.
 I also knew
                  he couldn't refuse a drink to save his life, and so I 
took him into a hotel, with the result you have seen. He knew me as
                  a man of letters, but didn't know my name or that I 
lived in the house we have just left. I couldn't make him stay in the
                  hotel, however. Drunk as he was he had still a muddled
 idea of responsibility, seeing which I offered to accompany him, and
                  brought a flask of rum with<span class="pb"> [PAGE 
280] </span>me to 'top off with.' He topped off with it, and the moment 
he sat down on the sofa where you saw him he went to sleep like
                  the debauched beast he is. For all that, I had to 
leave him something to recover upon. <i>Noblesse oblige,</i> you 
know—even in dealing with a bailiff. He'll be glad to find that bottle 
of beer when he wakes."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I have met other bailiffs since then, 
and the result of my experience is that, as I said in the beginning of 
this article,
                  the worst use to which you can put a man is to make 
him a bailiff.

 Cups of Tea.</h4>
               F. Rollett
               
               <p class="noindent">WE tumbled across him in the 
nor'-west corner of New South Wales. He was not what you might call a 
rouseabout. He seemed a
                  decent sort of fellow, and his name was Good; but he 
astonished us when he said he didn't like tea.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Not like tea?" spluttered old Packer. 
"You're not fool enough to drink the soup they call water here?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Sometimes I boil it," replied Good. 
"Sometimes, if it's extrasmelly, I boil it and put wood-ashes in it; 
then I strain it
                  through a handkerchief."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Well," said Jim Bride, enigmatically, 
"wot doesn't fatten fills. If I'd strained some of the post-and-rail tea
 I've seen
                  there wouldn't be much left to drink."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">One evening, when a common danger drew 
all our party together in human friendliness and Time weighed leaden 
hours, Good told
                  us why he didn't drink tea.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I had as good a claim on Flying Pig 
Hill as a man wants; and, though I lived pretty freely, I managed to put
 by a few notes.
                  I reckoned to buy a farm down in Gippsland and take 
things easy. I lived in a hut right on my claim; but I boarded at old
                  Ching Foo's, because I hated cooking for myself.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Old Ching Foo kept a straight enough 
house, and he treated me real well. He would yarn away sometimes as if I
 was a relation
                  of his; and once or twice he gave me a nip of the best
 brandy I ever tasted.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"One night, when I'd had a glass or two
 and was a bit excited-like because the claim was doing so well, Ching 
Foo said to
                  me,<span class="pb"> [PAGE 282] </span>'You come along
 my house; I got something I show. You not tell any other fellow; I say 
when go.'
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"It was dark when we started, but Ching
 Foo seemed to know the road all right, and I followed him. I don't know
 which way
                  we went, but we didn't walk more than a mile when we 
struck a house, and Ching Foo took me in. He put me down in a snug chair
                  in a room where one or two lights burned softly, and 
there was a curious tea-ey smell. Ching Foo left me; then the lights
                  went up gradually, and in came Ching Foo again, but he
 was dressed differently. He had on a blue, shiny coat and loose white
                  pants, and his pigtail hung down like a rope.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"We walked into another room, and there
 we had dinner. Not a boarding-house feed; but curried fowl, all sorts 
of vegetables,
                  and such puddings as I'd never tasted before. After 
dinner we had cigars; and then a young woman—a little, slim creature 
with
                  a veil over her face—brought in some tea, and I drank 
it. Now, that was tea. The smell of it seemed to send one into a kind
                  of dream, and the taste of it made the dream as nice 
as a dream could be. I saw old Ching Foo smiling away; then he handed
                  me the box of cigars and said: 'You smoke these; velly
 good. I smoke pipe'—and I knew by the old fellow's face that he was
                  going to take his opium.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I was in a most inexpressibly 
comfortable mood—perhaps the whisky I'd had in the afternoon might have 
softened me a bit,
                  but it was that tea that seemed to set me off. The 
girl entered with another cup. She came close against me, and there 
seemed
                  to be a sort of magnetism in her. When she took the 
saucer she seemed to touch my knee, and I declare that touch made me 
feel
                  as if I'd known her all my life and had been in love 
with her since I could remember. She was dressed in something thin and
                  soft; something that showed her rounded shoulders and 
bust. Lord, the very sight of her was enough to make a fellow feel 
drunk!
                  She thought I'd finished my tea, and stooped over me 
to take the cup; and then—I swear I couldn't help it—I slid the cup to
                  the floor and put my arms round her. She didn't draw 
back; she seemed to think that<span class="pb"> [PAGE 283] </span>I'd a 
right to do it. She snuggled softly against me; then she somehow dropped
 her veil and I saw her face. It was such a
                  face as I'd never seen before, and I suppose I shall 
never see again. It was white as milk, and small, and her eyes were 
beautiful
                  as—as ... and they looked into mine, and I stooped 
down and kissed her. She whispered 'Are you afraid of Ching Foo?' and I 
laughed
                  low. As if I'd be afraid of anybody then!
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">" 'Afraid of him!' said I.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"'O hush!' she said; 'be quiet, or he 
will come.'</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I kept quiet, for I had my arms around
 her, and I didn't want to move ever again. The whole thing seemed like a
 dream, but
                  I knew it was real. Such a dainty little figure, and 
her skin as soft and white as a flower.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"There was a slight sound, and in a 
moment she was out of my arms and had disappeared.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Ching Foo came in, and we had a yarn. I
 told him what the claim was yielding, and pretty well all the best side
 of my affairs;
                  and he just nodded his head.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Three nights after that Ching Foo 
asked me to go home with him again, and I jumped at the chance. It was 
just the same as
                  before. The room with the lights—the same sort of 
dinner, the wonderful cup of tea, then Ching Foo taking his opium—then 
the
                  girl coming in again. She and I drank the tea 
together. She sat by my side as close as close could be. I kissed her 
soft,
                  little mouth and her hair—I could have kept on kissing
 her all my life, and wanted nothing better to do. We didn't talk much,
                  but she asked me my name, and she got me to write it 
down on a bit of paper, and when I wrote it she kissed me and slipped
                  away. Then Ching Foo came in.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I fished for another invitation, but 
old Ching Foo didn't savee my hints until one day he asked me to lend 
him ten pounds,
                  and said he'd give me security on a section of land he
 owned, and, as he couldn't write, he got Tom Abner and Jerry Brash
                  to witness his mark. As he signed it, he whispered, 
'You satisfy take tea<span class="pb"> [PAGE 284] </span>alonga me, 
to-night?' and I said, 'You bet I'm satisfied, and devilish glad to get 
it.'
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Old Ching Foo said low-like to me, 
'You sign paper, too.' I was going to tell him that there was no 
occasion for me to sign,
                  but he seemed to know what was in my mind, and looked 
sulky, and I was thinking of the chance of seeing that girl, so I signed
                  just to please him, and he laughed like a happy boy.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"It came again—room, dinner, cigars, 
the cup of tea, and—and my girl. She seemed to come straight to my arms,
 and I held her
                  fast.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"I drank the cup of tea at a gulp when I
 found she would not share it. It tasted a bit bitter, being a trifle 
strong. I wonder
                  how I remember this, for I had her in my arms before 
the cup was well out of my hands. Her dark hair was loosened and hung
                  down in long, wavy lines; her veil lay on the floor. I
 looked into her eyes, she looked into mine; then her lips seemed to
                  come to mine, her arms went round my neck.... Poof! 
folks may talk about opium and that stuff; but that girl was real. Could
                  I remember it all so well after so many years? No, I 
held her, and I don't want heaven to be any better than that; and it
                  lasted—was it an hour or a second?...
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"When I came to myself I was in a 
stinking little hovel that some Chinese gardeners used to own, and when 
Tom Abner saw me
                  he said, 'Well, I'm blamed! Why, it's town-talk that 
you had bought Ching Foo's section and had gone down to Melbourne to
                  float a big thing in mines.'
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"When I went to the township I found 
that Ching Foo had presented a cheque signed by me at the bank, and had 
drawn out all
                  my money. Tom Abner and Jerry Brash had seen me sign 
the transfer, and had heard me say that it was all right, and that I
                  was satisfied.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Well, and I was satisfied. Ching may 
have got at me badly; but I'd pay twice as much—aye, a hundred times as 
much, if I had
                  it—for another meeting with that girl."

               "A. Chee"
               
               
               <p class="noindent">I OWN a tall, domesticated horse of 
the semi-angular type of beauty. He has an open countenance, a hollow 
back, and an expressive
                  hazel eye. A former owner of the horse removed the 
other eye. This person was vexed and mortified because he could not 
catch
                  the horse, and in the heat of the debate assaulted the
 animal with a gun. The horse has been sceptical about the 
trustworthiness
                  of human nature ever since. I have owned him for a 
long time now, but I have not yet won his entire confidence. His name is
                  Parkes.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He associates with a number of 
illiterate quadrupeds that roam the bush here, and they all regard 
Parkes as their chieftain.
                  When any member of the mob finds a patch of 
couch-grass, Parkes depresses his ears and sidles alongside with a sour 
look.
                  If the animal knows Parkes he goes away. But if he 
stays there, Parkes bites his neck and kicks him until he does adjourn.
                  Then my horse eats the grass in a thoughtful way, and 
afterwards gets another horse to reverse ends with him, and whisk the
                  flies off with his tail. But Parkes does not whisk for
 the other horse. He is too languid.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Many people think it is easy to catch 
Parkes, but they are wrong. They are deceived by the statuesque attitude
 he assumes
                  when another horse is being caught. But when you 
approach Parkes with a bridle, he smiles satirically and goes away quite
                  rapidly. That is, if you have only a bridle. But if 
you have a tin dish of corn, he takes the corn with him. He gets it by
                  degrees from your hand, and when you grab for his 
front hair he ducks and cross-counters with his front paws. He is very 
quick
                  with his left.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Last winter I made a rug for Parkes 
with two flour-bags and a<span class="pb"> [PAGE 286] </span>clothes-line.
 He was pleased with the effect, and at once struck up an intimacy with a
 neighbour's cow, although before that
                  he was a very bashful horse in female society.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The neighbour's cow's name is Mike. Her
 owner was facetious and named her Mike Howe. But (he is dead now) I am 
told he was
                  otherwise a most estimable man, and a model husband 
and father.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Mike and my horse became very 
affectionate, and my horse got quite vain and haughty, because of the 
distinguished look the
                  rug gave him. But one day, when he was trying to help 
Mike's calf into a lucerne paddock, the rug became disarranged. The
                  ropes straddled his back, and the main body of the rug
 clung confidingly to his abdomen. When he next called on Mike, she
                  received my horse coldly. He was hurt at this, and 
came home to me to have his garb refitted; but I took it off and made it
                  into a meat-safe.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Mike never afterwards associated with 
my horse. She even pretended that she did not recognise him, and dropped
 his acquaintance
                  altogether. Her cruelty broke my horse's heart, and he
 has never since recovered his old gaiety of spirit. He pushed Mike's
                  calf down a shaft last week; but he is still gloomy 
and abstracted.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I think his disposition is permanently 
soured.</p>

               <h4 class="normal">Hanging and Hell.</h4>
               Phil. Mowbray
               
               <p class="noindent">THERE are at least six Hanging Rocks 
and three Gallows Hills in New South Wales. There is one Hell. I've been
 there, thus:</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Assize time in Wagga Wagga and a man on
 trial for murder. Another man, myself, on trial of sobriety, dead 
broke, hat battered,
                  boots unlaced, swag all no-how, and so nervous that 
the gambolling of Pop scares me. Funny that that animal is never so 
delighted
                  as when I shoulder bluey. I pass the court-house; a 
knot of idlers are round the gate, a policeman comes out and says, 
"They'll
                  hang<span class="pb"> [PAGE 287] </span>him!" I'm off 
like a shot, and in my ears the din of "Hang him, hangin', hangin', 
hang, 'ang, 'ng—ng—ng!" Then I turn a corner
                  to get out of public gaze. Unluckily, I pass the side 
door of the building. I am spell-bound; there I see an awful visage,
                  a face with such a ghastly mouth, and such a dress 
below the mouth, for the mouth has taken charge of the face, like the 
Cheshire
                  Cat's grin in Wonderland. Then the grin and the hair, 
the mouth and the gown, the words and the black cap take me by the 
shoulders
                  and elsewhere and hustle me on to the river bank. 
"Hang, hang, hang—ng—ng!" and now I've got them. I know they're on me 
and
                  so does Pop, because he whines and fawns on me. But 
for Pop I'd have shown the horrors. Now I only feel them.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then I walk and walk and walk. It seems
 two days, but it's not so wearisome, because I have music,—that rhythm,
 you know,
                  always in my ears. It's company if it's horrible, and 
the dog is some consolation. Next, I find myself by a vineyard full
                  of angels; they give me three tumblers of wine and a 
bottle for the road. They wish me to stay, and see me through my 
recovery,
                  but—that grin, that mug, that wig, and the little 
black cap! I'm off.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Again I travel about a week, in my 
mind's eye, and camp near an old shed under a tree. There's a paling 
fence near, and it
                  looks like the bars of a cage or prison.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">But the tree—the gallows-tree! The 
boughs are scraggy, and the leaves white on top; there's a break in the 
middle, and a guard
                  round the barrel. It looks like that head. The gap is 
the cavernous mouth, and the soughing of the breeze is "Hang him, 
they'll
                  hang him!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Still, I'm not so badly off. I can see 
an angel or two feeding Pop. A man comes down with a pint of tea and a 
plate of soup.
                  He tells me this is the "Burnt Hut," and that the 
fires are Hell. Just then he's called by the overseer, and says "Hang 
him!"
                  Now I'm off again. The din begins, the tree shivers, 
the head wags, the mug mutters, some crows perch on the top and make
                  a black cap, and I fall asleep near the paling 
fence—the prison cage.
               </p>
               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 288] </span>
               
               <p class="normal">When I wake I look through. I see Pop, 
watching my swag on the other side, and a man tieing the legs of a 
sheep. That sheep
                  is, to me, myself. He skins it, and calls to his mate,
 "Come and help me to hang him!" The wretch is going to hang me, the
                  same good fellow who gave me the soup. Luckily, I spot
 the bottle of wine. I reach for it and drink it, holding the bottle
                  by the neck. I know that I am being hung—hanged, I 
mean; but I'm not going to let them touch me, myself, the "alter ego."
                  They come near me and fetch the overseer, who brings 
me a nip of the real Mackay. It is now a little funny: I'm hung, and
                  still drinking whisky, and the hangman isn't so bad. I
 suppose the overseer's the devil, because he says, in a sort of pitying
                  tone, "Well! isn't this hell?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Another snooze, and I awake. It ought 
to be dark, but it isn't. The night is lit up by bush-fires on and 
around a pinnacle
                  of smoke and flame. We can see the timbers falling, 
the sparks rising. "We" are the men and I. I can see the wig and the 
mouth
                  and the grin and the corpse, standing out like red 
lights on a murky background. A calico shroud has been tied round the 
sheep,
                  and it now looks like a suspended ghost. I fancy its 
soul has gone to—well, blazes was my thought. Then I become sure of it,
                  because the overseer—the devil, I mean—calls the men 
to look at the Hanging Rock, the pillar of fire, and tells them or half
                  asks them, "Isn't it hell?" What with the Hanging and 
the Hell, I start again (mentally), and have my little song of "Hang
                  him, hang him, hell, 'ell, well—not so bad—hang—hell!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">And I awoke; and behold, it was a 
dream. "Well, old fellow! Are you better? Can you cook? Can have a job 
if you like. Only
                  me and some fencers. We're out all day. Tackle it 
to-morrow. I'll give you a nip or two—I've had 'em myself."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">But there are few overseers like the 
one who used to be at the Burnt Hut, under the Hanging Rock. "Isn't it 
hell?"</p>

               <span class="pb"> [PAGE 289] </span><h4 class="normal">The
 School at Sergeant's.</h4>
               "Ponte"
               
               <p class="noindent">OF all the small bush schools I ever 
had the misfortune to be in charge of, I think with least regret of the 
school at Sergeant's.
                  And this, with other things, leads me to say that the 
experience of teachers does not vary so much with the schools as with
                  the places they board at. Practically, the schools are
 alike—little wooden boxes with iron roofs—cold as Kiandra in winter
                  and hot as Booligal in summer. Nowadays the buildings 
are even more uniform—built to style, as it were; but in my day the
                  only difference was in the width of the cracks. The 
children are always the same (God forgive them!); the results never 
vary;
                  and the same loneliness pervades all. But the chief 
difference in the place you board at is that each is the worst. All 
except
                  Sergeant's.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Old Sergeant was one of the finest men I
 ever saw—six-feet-two at sixty-three! A rugged and seamed old face, 
clean-shaven
                  but for a fringe of white hair about his neck; eyes 
clear as a child's; and a mouth that expressed determination except when
                  he was in company and couldn't get rid of the 
superfluous saliva engendered by his inactivity. He was a rough old 
customer,
                  with many quaint and truthful sayings—more or less 
concerning women, and more or less unprintable. But his veneration for
                  his wife was almost pathetic. It showed in his speech.
 With a total disregard for grammar, it was, "When me an' Tom was on
                  Lambing Flat," or "The time me and Bill Wade was 
overlandin',"—but every reference to her was "Mother and me"; and 
"Wasn't
                  it, mother?" comprised half of his yarns.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">The family were all married; and, in 
the long winter evenings, after my solitary tea—my mouth waters even now
 at the memory
                  of those preserves—I would go into the kitchen and 
find the old woman knitting socks, and old Sergeant making 
picture-frames
                  of fruit-stones and cones. A steaming glue-pot by his 
side, and pliers in his hand, he cracked the nuts and fitted the pieces
                  with such minute care that to cover three square 
inches of frame was a long night's work. After a while, I drew designs 
for
                  him to pick<span class="pb"> [PAGE 290] </span>out 
with different kinds of stones, and even essayed one myself—which was 
picked to pieces in more ways than one. And then,
                  in front of the log fire, he would tell stories of the
 old times, or I would play the fiddle.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He would never let me play my best 
piece—"Home, Sweet Home"—because: "When me and Tom was on Araluen—that 
was before mother
                  and me took up, wasn't it, mother?—we got word that a 
great fiddler, called Something-Whisky, was comin'. There was a bit
                  of a hall at the pub., and me and Tom was often there,
 doin'a bit of steppin' and such. Me and Tom was counted the best 
steppers
                  on the diggin's—leastways, Tom always played," he 
added, with characteristic modesty. "Well, Whisky took the hall, and we
                  all dressed up to take out our ten bobs' worth; and, 
my word! there was a mixed crowd there—wasn't there, mother? Well, 
Whisky
                  came out, and as soon as he starts we could see he was
 a fine player; but there was too much shakes and such for us. He ran
                  up and down like winkin' till big Tom M'Grath—you 
remember Tom, mother?—stands up on a seat and says: 'I move Jack 
Sergeant
                  does a step.' That was me; and before old Whisky knew 
where he was I was at it. Whisky stood on one side pattin' his fiddle
                  and speakin' some language to himself, while I gave a 
new step me and Tom had been practisin' on the quiet. Well, of course,
                  there was drinks; but no one remembered old Whisky, 
till he ups and starts playin' 'Home, Sweet Home,' just plain like. 
Sometimes
                  now, when I'm lyin' in bed, it comes to me; don't it, 
mother? Well, you never heard a lot of fellows cough and clear their
                  throats like we did. After that we cleared the stage, 
and made him promise only to play plain tunes we knew, and then we all
                  goes out and paid afresh to come in; didn't we, 
mother?"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">When the old woman died I offered to 
move, but old Sergeant would n't hear of it. "You stay along with me and
 we'll rub along—you
                  was a favourite of hers." One night he selected one

"Well," he said,

wife and put helpmate. She was that—true—wasn't you, mother?" said the
                  old man dreamily.

ten of us, and gazed down silently at the plain deal coffin. None of us 
knew any burial-service,
                  but something of the sort seemed necessary, so we 
stood puzzling our brains to recall some good action of the deceased. 
After
                  a lapse of several minutes Jones mentioned how the 
corpse had once treated Cornish Joe to a big burst. This had been better
                  left unsaid; for we all remembered that the sequel to 
that action was running through the traveller's pockets and abstracting
                  the contents.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">There was another silence of five 
minutes while we moved our feet about, shuffling the loose earth into 
rude circles. Then
                  Darbyshire whispered that perhaps if we sang something
 it would be better than keeping dead silence. There was no answer to
                  Darbyshire's suggestion.

were loosened at once, and each of us had some anecdote to relate of the
 perfidy of
                  the departed. For an hour or more we stayed, until the
 pauses grew longer between the yarns, and ultimately conversation came
                  to a stop. We shovelled in the earth and left a yellow
 mound to mark<span class="pb"> [PAGE 292] </span>the spot. Then we made
 for the Miner's Arms to drink the corpse's health.

               "Boiling Billy"
               
               <p class="noindent">THERE are many different ways of 
making a living; but selling Scripture texts is not one of them. I 
discovered this in two
                  days. A friend who frames pictures in Sydney gave me 
some nice little works of art with a passage of Scripture in one corner,
                  and I started out to supply a long-felt want. I always
 thought that when people are up to their eyes in debt and trouble would
                  be the right time to drop in with some nice little 
texts, setting forth that "The Lord will provide," etc. It seems not. 
But
                  I should have sold more if I had only known what part 
of the town the Christians live in. I'm satisfied of that. As soon as
                  I find that out I intend to make money. I met some 
queer people, though, for a person who doesn't know the town.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">One of them is the woman who tells you,
 after a lot of talk, that she has a house-full of pictures—more than 
she has room
                  to hang up; and just then one of the children opens 
the door wide and you discover that the walls are perfectly bare, 
excepting
                  here and there a large, red spot where some robust 
bed-insect paused abruptly. And I like the woman who opens the door and
                  smiles. When you put your pictures down on the 
door-step and start to clear your throat, she slams the door and knocks 
your
                  pictures right to the bottom of the steps. Your throat
 clears very suddenly just here, and you quote Scripture which is n't
                  on the texts. This person always lives in a fine, big 
house, being a lady.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">After a few of these confidential 
interviews, I ceased to wonder how anarchists were built. I have a 
recipe which would make
                  an anarchist of Job. If this meets the eye of any 
anarchist who wishes<span class="pb"> [PAGE 293] </span>to begin work in
 Sydney, I will be glad to point out some houses which I think could be 
blown to pieces conveniently, and
                  at little cost. I hate to see any man out of work.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Then there is the Salvation woman, who 
reads your texts over in a sacred voice as though afraid of stepping on 
her creed,
                  and tells you to "Remember what them says!" Every 
minute at that house is time heaved away. The Sunday-school 
teacher—ditto.
                  I think a lot of the man who sits smoking his pipe on 
the back verandah, and, when you come to the side-gate and ask if that
                  dog will bite, says, "Sometimes." A second glance at 
the house convinces you that the people in there don't know a nice, neat
                  picture when they see it. Consequently, they don't see
 it.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">I also met the man who said "he got 
some of them Scripture things once, but the kids knocked"—well, a very 
tropical place—"out
                  of them." Yes, I met some queer people. In fact, the 
only people I did n't meet were the people who wanted some nice little
                  religious pictures. If the Apostle Paul were here now,
 he would soon knock off selling Scripture texts, and start out with
                  "The Life of the Kelly Boys," or "Bushranging in 
Australia." Then he might make a living.

come from England to Yowlahmine Station with a letter of recommendation 
to Mr. Foster,
                  our boss. His name was Edward—Ted, we used to call 
him; Ted Oscott. Nobody thought of calling him Mister now, except Maggie

               <p class="normal">Maggie's father was the married man on 
the home station. Ted thought a lot of Maggie, and often used to sit 
with her under<span class="pb"> [PAGE 294] </span>the old fig-tree 
behind the store of a night and tell her about England and his people.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">One night he asked her why she didn't 
call him "Ted" and not "Mister Oscott." She said she did n't like, as he
 might think
                  her forward. Maggie was very shy.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Ted thought he would change the 
conversation, so he asked her if she knew that Murphy was leaving. 
Murphy was one of the married
                  boundary-riders.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Maggie said she had heard her father 
saying something about it, and she was very glad if it was true; because
 she never did
                  like Murphy, and did n't want to see him any more—or 
his wife, either.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Ted assured her that it was true, and 
the boss had offered the billet to him (Ted), remarking at the time that
 it would be
                  a good chance for him to marry Maggie.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Ted then drew a little closer, and 
asked her if he might tell Mr. Foster that he would take his offer. 
Maggie said she would
                  see what her father said.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Anyhow, it was soon arranged. They were
 to ride into Nerribong on Monday, get married and spend a few days, and
 then on Sunday
                  ride home to Murphy's, where everything would be ready
 for them.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Nerribong, Saturday night. Maggie had 
gone to bed, and Ted was paying Hennessy, the landlord, for the week's 
accommodation,
                  when who should walk into the bar but Murphy! Ted 
ordered drinks, and Murphy wished him luck and told him he had got 
another
                  job, at Greendale, and was going out in the morning. 
Then they went to bed.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">When Ted walked into the yard next 
morning, two horses were hung up at the post, saddled. One was Murphy's;
 the other the
                  one that Maggie had ridden in from Yowlahmine. Murphy 
had brought them up from the paddock, but couldn't find Ted's horse
                  anywhere. Ted went to look for him, but with no 
success.

               <p class="normal">When he came back Maggie was mounted 
and ready, and Murphy was pulling down the slip-rails to let her pass 
through.<span class="pb"> [PAGE 295] </span>Having got both horses 
outside, he carefully replaced the rails and bade Ted "Good morning!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Wait a minute," says Ted. "Where are 
you going?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Greendale," answers Murphy.</p>

 to-night."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Ah, well," says Ted, "you had better 
come and have a drink before you go. It's pretty sultry this morning."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Going to have a hot day, I think," 
says Murphy.</p>

barrin' straight ahead to nowhere in particular. What he was goin' 
for—he
                  didn't know. Once he scorned the offer of a good 
billet, when he was downright 'ard-up for one. It came o' bein' 
'ead-over-ears
                  in some big scheme or other in his mind.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Often as not he'd go to stations with 
his tucker-bags and come<span class="pb"> [PAGE 298] </span>away with 
nothin'. Couldn't recollect what took him up, and forgot his bags 
thinkin' of it. Then he'd 'ave to ante-up a bob
                  to a blackfellow to show him where he left his swag. 
When it come to payin', Barker 'd say, quite innocent, "Do I owe you
                  a shillin': what was it for, now? I can't think." "Me 
find um swag." "But that's my swag. I put it there." "Das right, boss.
                  You been lose um camp, see?" Barker 'd barney over 
that for an hour sometimes, but he'd stump up at last. He lost a mint o'
                  money that way.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Anyhow, ratty as he was, he hit on a 
good plan to steer by. When he'd come to his campin'-place he'd take his
 boots off, and
                  leave 'em pointin' the right way. Then he could twist 
about as much as he liked takin' his swag off, and makin' preparations
                  in gen'ral for the night. Till them boots was right, 
though, he darsn't turn, or he'd be flabbergasted altogether. In the
                  mornin' everything must be shouldered for the track 
'fore he dare step into 'em. Otherwise he might get turned pickin' up
                  something. He did go without 'em wonst, and it wasn't 
till he'd picked forty or so thorns out o' his feet it occurred to him
                  he was in the 'abit o' wearin' boots. A trav'ler 
fetched 'em along for him that time.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">One night he 'ad to get up and go to 
the waterhole for a drink. That was the turnin'-point in his life. He 
put his boots on—it
                  bein' the time snakes go picnickin' and matin'; and 
there's nothin' in the wide world that sets Barker's hair standin' on
                  end more'n snakes.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">When he got up next day the boots was 
facin' the waterhole.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Dang it!" says Barker; "I didn't know I
 'ad to cross that!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">But the boots pointed that way, so 
there was no get out of it. It was only fifty yards round that hole, but
 leather said cross
                  it, and 'cross it went Barker—up to his neck. He felt 
miserable when he got out, for Barker wasn't used to bein' wet. So he
                  stripped off to dry. When he was ready to start ag'in 
he found his compass 'ad gone bung once more. One boot pointed east,
                  t' other west. "Now, which way am I goin'?" says 
Barker. He sat down to think it out. But it wasn't no use. Thinkin' made
                  him giddy, and put<span class="pb"> [PAGE 299] </span>him
 in such a gen'ral muddle that he lost sight o' what he wanted to think 
about. So he saw there was no help then but to
                  wait till some one came along.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">So Barker filled his pipe. He 'adn't 
'ad a smoke that mornin', and his mouth was waterin'. Soon he was 
puffin' away big licks,
                  and found it a good help to his brain. So he tried 
ag'in to think them boots the one way, and finished up with bandicootin'
                  murphies in the old country. He was that disgusted 
that he grabbed the old clay-dabber to knock the ashes out, and then he
                  saw as he'd never lit it. Barker saved a lot o' 'bacca
 in his time forgettin' the match part o' the performance.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">As luck 'appened, a stockman came in 
sight about dinner-time. Barker cooeyed, and he came over. " 'Scuse me,"
 says Barker;
                  "would you do me a favor, mate? I'm a bit flummoxed." 
"Certainly, old man—if it's not too much trouble. What is it?" "Ah,
                  what is it? Lemme see—Oh! ... Will you tell me where 
I'm goin' to, and oblige—yours sincerely" ... Barker was workin' it off 
on
                  his fingers.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Why, strike me dead!" says the 
stockman to himself, "that bloomin' old fool's mad!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Where am I goin'?" asks Barker again.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Off yer nanny," says the stockman, 
riding off. "Keep straight on, and you'll not be long afore you're 
there."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Barker chewed that over for an hour. 
One boot said east and one said west. Which was straight on? "Dang me if
 I don't go with
                  Bobindie," says Barker—he called one of them boots 
Bobindie. So he put Bobindie on and went west. That night he struck a 
dry
                  gully, and near perished for want of water. "You're 
the devil's own," says Barker. "To blazes with you!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">He got back next night—how, I dunno—and
 he says to the other boot, that he called Brian Boroo: "Brian," he 
says, "we'll go
                  east at your wish, and the Lord strike you blind if 
your designs be treacherous!" So he put on Brian Boroo and went east,
                  leaving Bobindie to perish. He'd 'ave no more truck 
with that gentleman.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">In three hours Brian Boroo kicked ag'in
 a slug o' gold, and<span class="pb"> [PAGE 300] </span>Barker danced 
and howled in his delight. Before sundown he struck this one-'orse place
 where I'm treed now. But in Barker's
                  eyes, with that slug shining in 'em, this miserable 
old creek was Heaven. So here he stuck. He was offered a tidy sum 
afterwards
                  by a shindykit in the township to show 'em the spot 
where Brian hit the slug; but, Lor' bless you! by that time Barker knew
                  as much of its whereabouts as a gorilla.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Anyway, he took the old blucher off, 
and knelt down 'fore the 'ouses and kissed him. "Brian Boroo," says 
Barker, "you 're
                  a brick!" So he pensioned him off straight away, 
and—well, there's the old fellow, snug and comfortable, in that glass 
case.

               <p class="normal">Mrs. Dargan went out of the parlour, 
and soon came back followed by Mary and her lover, a hard-faced young 
boundary-rider,
                  who, fortunately for himself and the object of his 
affections, had ridden over to the Squatters' Rest that morning.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"So!" said the priest, sternly, "so! 
ye've not had the dacency to wait moi comin'?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The young couple made no reply.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"How do ye expect to obtain a

widout God's lave? Kneel
                  down, the pair of ye! Now, say the worrds afther me. 
Mrs. Dargan, call all hands in as witnesses!"
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">For some minutes the ceremony 
proceeded; then the priest asked, "Mary O'Neill, do ye take this man for
 your husband?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yer ain't asked 'im if 'e'll 'ave me

               <p class="normal">"Whisky all round, mother!" cried Ted 
Hogan; and all joined in the toast which followed.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Is there annything else now, Mrs. 
Dargan?" asked the priest, pocketing the pound-note given him by the 
newly-wedded man.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Yes, yer riverince; there's a

               <p class="normal">"Heavens! the sin, the sin of it all! 
Fetch the mother and choild in at once."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">A pale young woman was brought in, 
bearing in her arms a fine little boy a month or two old.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Ah! Jane, you've been in a divil of a 
hurry," said the priest, not unkindly. "Who stand sponsors for this 
choild? God bless
                  him! He's a beauty, too."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">A toothless old rabbiter in for a 
spree, and a young fellow from a neighbouring selection, stepped 
forward, and the ceremony
                  was soon over.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"There, Jane, me gurrl, the little wan 
is as pure as snow now. But what's all those tears for? Mrs. Dargan, 
what's wrong?"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">The women-folk, as if by magic, had all
 begun to sob; and the men stood here and there conversing in whispers 
and looking
                  very glum.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Come now, mother, what's the maning of
 it all?" asked the priest again, and impatiently this time.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Ah, father, there's pretty Nellie 
yet!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"An' what, in heaven's name, is wrong 
with her?—the angel of the flock. The pride of the Big Gum Plain. The 
flower among so
                  many weeds."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">There was a ring of alarm in the old 
man's tones, and he looked anxiously from one to the other.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Faith, father, it's buryin' she 
wants."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Burying? Nellie dead! No, no. So 
bright, so fair. The queen of you all! Not dead!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Indade, father."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"Take me to her!"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"She's all nicely laid out; with a 
pretty coffin, too, made by Ted, here. The poor lamb died yester-morn."</p>
               
               <p class="normal">Mrs. Dargan led the priest into an 
adjoining room where, on a stretcher, lay the body of poor Nellie. She 
had been a very
                  beautiful girl, and even Death could not rob her 
perfect features of their charm. The long golden hair had been carefully
                  brushed and<span class="pb"> [PAGE 303] </span>trained
 down each side of the reclining figure. On her breast was a bunch of 
wild flowers.
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">"She's bin ailin' since your last 
visit, father. The young gentleman from Mooraboo run was after her, and 
Nellie was very
                  fond of him. But the damn blackguard, savin' your 
presence, father, wint away an' got spliced to a lady in Adelaide, an' 
our
                  girl here broke her poor heart an' died."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">Mrs. Dargan told her tale with many 
sobs.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"And was she innocent, do you think, 
mother?" asked the priest, anxiously.</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"More's the pity, no, father. She——"</p>
               
               <p class="normal">"God, God! The sin, the sin! Poor lamb,
 to be wrecked by that son of the devil. Wait until Oi meet him!—which, 
plase Heaven,
                  will be soon. Now bring all hands in, Mrs. Dargan, and
 Oi'll say prayers."
               </p>
               
               <p class="normal">And when the prayer was over he spoke 
to them about the savage way they were living, and said the back-blocks 
should be called
                  the Black-blocks, for there was no light there. An 
hour later, after Nellie's body had been placed in the rough grave 
prepared
                  for it, Father Connolly took his leave of the shanty 
and its inmates, blessing them all from his seat in the saddle. And as
                  he rode away a tear trickled down his face. "Lord!" he
 cried, "when will women know men?"

Swallow"); literary writer. Born on the Weddin Mountain diggings, Near 
Grenfell, N.S.W., 17th
                  June, 1869. His father was Peter Hertzberg Larsen, a 
Norwegian; his mother Louisa Albury (of English yeoman stock), a native
                  of Guntawang, near Mudgee, N.S.W. (Thus Lawson's name 
is really Larsen; but the Anglicised form appears to have been nearly
                  always used by his father, who is "Peter Larsen" in 
his marriage certificate, but "Peter Archibald Lawson" in his son's 
birth
                  certificate. The "Archibald" results from a 
misunderstanding on the part of the minister who officiated at the 
christening,
                  and who, being rather deaf, mistook "Hertzberg" for 
"Archibald," and sent the young Australian writer through the world with
                  an English instead of a Norse middle-name—much to his 
father's disgust.) Peter Larsen was the son of a Norsk teacher of 
navigation,
                  and a clever man with brain and hand. Henry Lawson's 
mother is well-known in Sydney as speaker and writer, and is 
proprietress
                  of the woman's paper <i>Dawn</i>. At the time of 
Lawson's birth his father was a miner, but when he was a few months old 
his parents took a farm at Wilbertree,
                  near Mudgee, N.S.W. His father gradually drifted into 
contracting, and in helping him and assisting on the farm Lawson made
                  acquaintance with the bush life round his home. At 17 
he came with his mother to Sydney, where he learnt the trade of 
coach-painter.
                  His first published composition was "The Song of the 
Republic," verses contributed to <i>The Bulletin</i> in 1887, and since 
then his pen has rarely been idle. In '89 he went to Albany, W.A., 
following his trade. Returned to Sydney,
                  and helped on a radical weekly, <i>The Republican</i>.
 In '90–91 was on the staff of <i>The Boomerang</i>, Brisbane. In '92 
travelled from Bourke to the Queensland border, "swagging it" as bush 
labourer for six months. In '93 went
                  to Maoriland; occupied as sawmill labourer and 
telegraph lineman. Returned to Sydney; was for a month on staff of <i>The

               <p class="normal">SOUTER, CHARLES HENRY ("Nil"); doctor 
of medicine. Born at Aberdeen Scotland, 11th October, 1864; father 
English, mother Scottish.
                  "Childhood passed in Aberdeen, Birmingham, and London.
 Left school at 14, and came with family to Australia. (There was not
                  then visible any glimmering of the burst of poetical 
fire which has since rent my being.) Voyaged to this land per 
full-rigged
                  ship <i>City of Corinth</i>, to Sydney direct with 
general cargo; 100 days out. Then three years' wild freedom (I had 
passed the College of Surgeons'
                  prelim. before leaving England) with a horse, a 
revolver, and a kangaroo-dog, etc., on the head waters of the 
Castlereagh.
                  A gorgeous and halcyon period indeed. In 1882 went to 
the 'Grahnit Ceety' to start medicine. Came out with a degree and a
                  wife in 1887; then followed three years in the 
Never-Never in charge of a hospital. A daughter born and a wife 
lost;—restlessness;—ship's
                  surgeon to China ports and back; and now for ten years
 lodge-surgeon and J.P. in South Australia. Again a husband and father;
                  'dropping into poetry' like Wegg—and occasionally into
 prose."
