LORE (Literature Object Re-use and Exchange)

LORE is a Firefox extension developed at the UQ ITEE eResearch Lab through the 
Aus-e-Lit project for publishing and authoring compound objects and annotations.

http://itee.uq.edu.au/~eresearch/projects/aus-e-lit/

DISTRIBUTION
LORE is distributed an an XPI file (Firefox extension) via the Mozilla addons site:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lore/

DEVELOPMENT

An Aptana / Eclipse project file is provided in the repository, however any JavaScript, XML and HTML 
editing environment would be suitable for development, for example Spket IDE http://spket.com/

Use ant (dist-nojar) to build the XPI file

You can point Firefox directly at the eclipse project during development.
We recommend setting up a new profile for development (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Setting_up_extension_development_environment)
Create a text file named lore@maenad.itee.uq.edu.au in your Firefox profile extension directory
On Windows this will typically be:
 C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<profile name>\extensions
On Mac OSX:
 /Users/<your username>/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/<profile name>/extensions
 
The contents of that text file should be the file path to the project e.g.
C:\Workspace\lore

If you want to see LORE debug output, you'll need Firebug with Tracing installed in your development profile.
Chromebug (from the same site) can also be used for debugging/inspecting the extension.

firebug-1.7X.0b4 is the most recent version with tracing available from
http://getfirebug.com/releases/firebug/1.7X/
Firebug 1.7X is only officially compatible with Firefox up to version 4. 
The tracing console has recently been split into a separate addon for versions 5 onwards.
We are in the process of switching to the new tracing console. 
In the meantime, we unpack Firebug 1.7X and edit the install.rdf file so that it can be installed on Firefox 5 and later.

Some tests are provided which can be run with Mozmill (Mozmill supports both unit tests and functional UI testing) https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Mozmill_Tests
Install the Mozmill extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9018
Tests are expressed in JavaScript and can be loaded and run via the Mozmill IDE
